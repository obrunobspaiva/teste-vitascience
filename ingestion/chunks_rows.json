Schwartz FOREWORD Welcome to the most sought aer direct marketing masterpiece. is book was recently selling for over $900 dollars used—so I decided to re- issue it. It is a real privilege to bring Gene Schwartz’s advertising wisdom back into print. We built a wonderful business based on his wisdom. He was a special delight and a treat to know—Gene was 6’2” and reminded me of Gary Cooper in e Fountainhead. But Gene had much more charm and wit and a fabulous, unforgettable smile. Exciting sight—watching the multi-talented genius’s \u0016ngers \u0019ying over the keyboard creating another brilliant ad. And then he’d sit back with that great smile, read it over and enjoy it more and more. Gene wrote advertising copy for the best direct marketers in America. And then he published a book in 1964 titled How to Double Your Child’s Grades in School, following up with How to Double Your Power to Learn and then Breakthrough Advertising in 1966. He was very clever—he exchanged his copywriting for access to mailing list names and promoted his own books to them! But then Gene had a stroke in 1978 and he had trouble typing … for it aﬀected his right side. But he worked and worked until he became quite pro\u0016cient typing with just his le hand. My big idea—Retain Gene as a business consultant instead of a copywriter to guarantee him a regular income. He became very important to us in that new role. He helped very much in the creation of the Bottom Line/Personal concept and of our editorial style. Awesome. en there was Gene III, the scientist, always reading the leading- edge science books and belonging to a very sophisticated group that met weekly to discuss the implications of those scienti\u0016c advances on society. Finally, there was Gene IV—an amazing talent as an art collector, together with his wife Barbara, a famous interior designer. ey built a fabulous art collection betting on Hans Hoﬀman Morris Lewis, Frank Stella, Donald Judd and Milton Avery well before anyone else had heard of them. eir \u0016rst acquisition was by the color-pioneer Hans Hoﬀman. It took me years to appreciate Hoﬀman’s work. Barbara also helped me build an incredible collection of photographs that are now at the Art Institute of Chicago. On my \u0016rst gallery tour with them—I discovered a crumpled photo by the Starn twins that had two words on it— Confusion/Order. at is what I’m devoted to—bringing order from confusion. So Barbara and I built a very exciting Lessons in Life collection. I was her \u0016rst art advisory client. And it is with her generous permission that we bring Gene’s classic book back into the world. Martin Edelston Founder and President. Boardroom Inc. Publisher of Bottom Line/Personal January 2004 PREFACE TO THE BOARDROOM EDITION is book was \u0016rst published in 1966—what seems to be three lifetimes ago. It was put out by Prentice-Hall, a marvelous house: it sold only a few thousand copies.

directly credit reading this book with their making millions of dollars. is is amazing enough, but even more remarkable is the fact that— when I look back on it—not a single one of these people was a copywriter. Here is a book that is called Breakthrough Advertising … and yet was used by men who were not in the business of advertising at all, to make more money than most of us ever dream of accumulating. How did this happen? Why was a publisher, a \u0016nancier, a manufacturer of novelties, able to make so very much money with a book that is about putting sentences together? (e \u0016nancier told me that, within one year aer obtaining the book, he had raised his net worth from $100,000 to $10 million). Are the sentences contained in the pages that follow actually that powerful? Can they change the fortunes of men so radically? Are they far more universally adaptable than I had \u0016rst thought… so they are no longer about advertising products, but literally about opening whole new markets for them? erefore, eighteen years later, when Boardroom Books asked me to republish this text. I had to study it again, with the fresh eyes of a person who had not read it in all that time, to see what was the real content of my book, and its real eﬀect on its readers. I did. I discovered the secret. And I am using this introduction now to admit my red-faced shame. What I had thought I had written those many years ago was a book on advertising; what I actually put down on these pages was an entirely diﬀerent book, on a far broader theme: ere is a way to develop an entirely new market for a new or an old product. at way involves a certain number of clearly de\u0016ned steps. And in this book 1 show you every single one of those steps. As you may know, all of us—no matter what oﬃcial designation we give the industry we do business in—are actually on a deeper level, in exactly the same profession. We are all simply creating or exploiting markets for our products. When the market is born, our business is simultaneously given birth. When it grows so does our share of it. When it is mature, our sales charts develop their \u0016rst aches and pains. And at that point, if we can develop a fresh new market for that old product, it is exactly as if we achieved the Faustian dream, and enabled that product to drink from the proverbial “Fountain of Youth.” We are all primarily conceptual midwives, helping give birth to new markets for our products. All the other functions we or our business, perform—the manufacturing, distribution, service, and all the rest—are simply adjuncts to this vital central process.

We gauge its true potential \u0016nancial strength, and then we focus all the people, all the money and all the desire that makes it up on one ultimate object: our own product. Most of the time, the market exists before our product, and we simply tap its present strength. But, in this era of constant change, we ourselves may help give it its \u0016rst viable \u0016nancial form. We may sense that people want computers in their homes as well as their oﬃces … or want to walk around all day with music plugged into their ears … or would like to spend three air-conditioned hours in a faraway galaxy, battling with light- swords against evil and tyranny. Making a market, then, is not as I thought when I originally wrote this book, simply a matter of making an ad. It is also the making of a product. And it is the making of a conduit through which that product can be obtained by the people whom you have made desire it more than an equivalent sum of their money. is book outwardly talks about the sentences that make up the primary appeal of that product to that market. But its true and deeper message is found when it is interpreted as a market-diviner, and a market-intensi\u0016er. In other words, its message will show you how to \u0016nd your “dream” market, and how to drive it into a national “feeding frenzy.” And I have also made an equally important discovery upon reviewing this book since it was \u0016rst published. e examples in its pages have grown slightly older, but the principles that these examples manifest are timeless. For example, if I were writing this book today, its examples would show more appreciation of feminism, environmental awareness, health and \u0016tness striving—even the blessed sexual revolution. ey would be more open and more frank than they could have been then. All this is for the good—but this book is not about reviving today’s ads, but creating from scratch tomorrow’s winners! is book is about avoiding the need for copying or imitating another product or advertisement. So today’s examples are as “outdated” as those of two decades ago. is book is about what happens next, and the fundamental rules of making a fortune out of slightly redirecting that tomorrow. You see, people don’t change: only the direction of their desires do. ey cannot be made to want anything, nor is it necessary to create want. All that is necessary is to be able to channel those wants into the proper products that oﬀer legitimate satisfaction for them.

Not one single thing has changed in that regard since I wrote this book. Nor will it ever alter in the slightest. So this book is not about building better mousetraps. It is, however, about building larger mice, and then building terrifying fear of them in your customers. In other words, it is about helping to shape the largest and strongest market possible, and then intensifying that market’s reaction to its basic need or problem, and to the “exclusive” solution you have to oﬀer it. Ask Rodale Press—for whom I sold over twenty million dollars of a single book, e Practical Encyclopedia of Natural Healing. Ask the publisher of this book. Boardroom Reports, Inc.—who started out with $3,500 in total working capital, and who will probably do more than 25 million dollars in gross volume next year, with I am proud to say at least a little bit of assistance from me. Ask the seventeen businesses I’ve started or helped start… (Twenty- \u0016ve percent of just one of them was sold for close to a million dollars in one day.) ese principles work. ey discover markets. ey build markets. ey intensify markets. ey revitalize markets. ey perform, in sum, the invaluable function of giving you customers for the products you want or have to sell. And that’s what we all need, isn’t it? Customers. is, therefore, is a book full of customers—for your products. It is really nothing else. Just customers, by the millions. Eighteen years have passed. ree lifetimes. ey’ve been good years, and good lives. I hadn’t read the book since then, but some hidden part of me had remembered it, and I think it’s worth your reading now. If you agree with me, why not write and tell me so. I have several millionaires, and multi-millionaires, to my credit now. I’d like to make the next one YOU. Please help me. Gene Schwartz INTRODUCTION Creativity Can Be Made to Order If You Follow is Simple Rule If you expect a scholarly tome on advertising, stop here. I am a mail order copy writer who makes his living by producing results—in carefully-measured dollars of pro\u0016t—from the written word. My income—my standard of living—depends bluntly and directly upon my ability to sell. And I have no salesmen to help me; no store- reputation to help me: no point-of-purchase reminders, no discounts, and no friendly sales clerks to give my products a push. I sell, or do not sell, on the basis of one tool alone—my ad. erefore, I have done a great deal of thinking and experimenting with these ads. And, since I have had the good fortune to own my own mail order \u0016rms for the last eleven years, I have had far greater freedom than most copy writers to put my ideas to a conclusive test and to see whether or not they really work.

learn techniques and approaches to copy—especially new-product and new-slant copy—that you learn in no other branch of this business. Some of these techniques I have never seen discussed in any other article or book on copy writing—and I think I’ve read most of them. I have explained these techniques in detail in the hope that they will prove as pro\u0016table to other copy writers as they’ve been for me. Can they be used by non-mail-order copy writers as well? Most assuredly. J. K. Lasker once said that mail order makes a copy writer, but his real payoﬀ comes when he applies his mail order techniques to general advertising. I think that B.B.D. & O., Ted Bates, Ogilvy, Young & Rubicam and a dozen other agencies prove this every day. erefore I’ve written this book—not from the mail order perspective alone—but from the universal problem of all copy writing: How to write a headline—and an ad that follows it—that will open up an entirely new market for its product. An ad that will give a new product immediate pro\u0016t: that will give an old product a brand-new slant; that will give a competitively-battered product a new weapon—not only to protect itself against its imitators but to actually damage or destroy the loyalty of their following. ese objectives cannot be achieved by following somebody else’s formula—no matter how successful it was for them. ey demand creativity. ey demand a brand-new headline; a brand-new approach to the market: a literal advertising “breakthrough.” Hence the title of this book. is, then, is a practical book, of practical rules that produce, and exploit, creativity, and that are meant to pay oﬀ on the very \u0016rst ad. To put them to work, you start with these basic facts. Basic Facts of Life for Copy Writers Writing copy is like playing the stock market, or being an atomic physicist. Basically all three of these professions—copy writing, speculation and science—are exactly alike. e same keys make each one of them work. And if you realize this, you can double the eﬀectiveness of your copy overnight. Consider these facts: All three of them deal with immense natural forces, gargantuan forces thousands of times more powerful than the men who use them. In science, they are the fundamental energies of the universe. In speculation, they are the billion-dollar tides and currents of the market place. In copy writing they are the hopes and fears and desires of millions upon millions of men and women, all over the world. e men who use these forces did not create them; they can neither turn them on nor shut them oﬀ, they can neither diminish them nor add to them. But they can harness them! e scientist did not create the energy of the sun; hut he can direct that energy into the explosion of an atom bomb. e speculator did not create the enormous growth of the

increase in his capital. And the copy writer does not create the desire of millions of women all over America to lose weight; but he can channel that desire onto a particular product, and make its owner a millionaire. is, then, is the end goal—to take these gigantic natural forces and harness them to our own uses. But how do we do it? No two of these forces are alike. Each is unique; each operates in a diﬀerent way. e same formula, carefully worked out to release atomic energy, fails completely to solve the problem of rocket propulsion. e same pattern of investment, that spots the upturn in electronics and makes a fortune, loses that fortune in uranium. And the same advertising appeal, that builds an industry in reducing, collapses completely when applied to health foods, even though both advertisements may reach exactly the same audience. Why? Because no formula works twice. Each and every formula is simply the written solution to a particular problem that occurred in the past. Change even one part of that problem, and you need an entirely diﬀerent formula. at’s why memorizing theories won’t make you a scientist, or studying charts won’t make you a market wizard, or rewriting somebody else’s headlines won’t make you a copy writer. What will work? Innovation, of course. Continuous, repeated innovation. A steady stream of new ideas—fresh new solutions to new problems. Created—not by the impossible route of memory—but by analysis. In a \u0016eld in which the rules are constantly changing… where the forces that determine the outcome are constantly shiing… where new problems are constantly being encountered every day… rules, formulas and principles simply will not work. ey are too rigid—too tightly bound to the past. ey must he replaced by the only known method of dealing with the Constantly New—analysis. And what is analysis? It is a series of measuring rods, check-points, signpost questions that show you where a particular force is going, and enable you to get there \u0016rst. It is a series of rough guesses, based on past successes, that enables you to cut through the surface of a problem to see what makes it tick. Analysis is the art of asking the right questions and letting the problem dictate the right answers. It is the technique of the break-through. And it can be learned—just as surely as grammar, mathematics or spelling. e \u0016rst part of this book is about analysis, applied to the profession of copy writing. Its basic thesis is this: Every new market—every new product—every new advertisement is a fresh new problem that never existed before on the face of this earth.

BEFORE 1 - MASS DESIRE: THE FORCE THAT MAKES ADVERTISING WORK—AND HOW TO FOCUS IT ONTO YOUR PRODUCT Let’s get right down to the heart of the matter. e power, the force, the overwhelming urge to own that makes advertising work, comes from the market itself, and not from the copy. Copy cannot create desire for a product. It can only take the hopes, dreams, fears and desires that already exist in the hearts of millions of people, and focus those already-existing desires onto a particular product. is is the copy writer’s task: not to create this mass desire—but to channel and direct it. Actually, it would be impossible for any one advertiser to spend enough money to actually create this mass desire. He can only exploit it. And he dies when he tries to run against it. is has been shown time and time again in the automotive \u0016eld, for example. In 1948, in order to display their rising standard of living, the American public decided they wanted a longer, lower, wider car. Chrysler chose to buck the trend; and oﬀered a \u0016ne, functional car—with more head, leg and shoulder room on the inside—but shorter and squatter on the outside. A multi-million dollar campaign was prepared by one of the most creative agencies in America. But the results—against the tide of mass desire—were catastrophic. In 1954, cars had become universally long; and drivers were appraising each other’s car in terms of horsepower. Here was the rise to dominance of a vast new public demand. e Twin-H Hudson Hornet, the twin-exhaust Cadillac, the Chrysler 300—all in turn exploited this trend, and rode it to gain millions of dollars in extra sales. e Ford Company decided to play it down, and devoted millions of advertising dollars to sell safety.

But perhaps the most painful proof was the Edsel. Here was a good car, backed by a deluge of \u0016ne advertising, which died trying to \u0016ght the overwhelming switch in demand to a cheap, simple, inexpensive-to-run compact car. Let me repeat. is mass desire must already be there. It must already exist. You cannot create it, and you cannot \u0016ght it. But you can—and must —direct it, channel it, focus it onto your particular product. What Is is Mass Desire—and How Is It Created? We can de\u0016ne this Mass Desire quite simply. It is the public spread of a private want. Advertising is a business of statistics. We deal with percentages of population. We address our ads to individuals; and yet the success of our advertising depends on thousands, or even millions, of these individuals sharing the same response to these ads—the response of wanting our product enough to pay us the price we ask for it. Before these individuals can share this buying response, they must \u0016rst share the desire upon which our ad is based. Privately, each of them wants the same thing. Publicly there are enough of them to repay us the cost of advertising, manufacturing and selling, plus a pro\u0016t. It is the moment when a private desire is shared by a statistically signi\u0016cant number of people, large enough to pro\u0016tably repay selling these people, that a market is born. is market may consist of a desire shared by only a few thousand people, such as the urge to own \u0016ne antiques. Or it may be shared by tens of millions, as the desire to lose weight. But it is there, demanding to be satis\u0016ed, waiting only for the information that will direct it onto a particular product. Since these mass desires are shared by millions of people, they take years to develop, and they are created by social, economic and technological forces far greater than advertising itself can command. It is this fact, when used correctly that gives advertising its enormous potential for pro\u0016t. By simply directing this gigantic, already-existing mass desire—rather than being required to create it—advertising thus commands an economic force hundreds of times more powerful than the mere number of dollars that the advertiser can spend on it. is is the Ampli\u0016cation Eﬀect of successful advertising—the reason that $1 spent on such advertising can create $50 or even $100 in sales. But this Ampli\u0016cation Eﬀect takes place only when advertising exploits already-existing desire. When it tries to create this desire, it is no longer advertising but education. And, as education, it can produce at best only one dollar in sales for every dollar spent on advertising. No single advertiser can aﬀord to educate the American public. He must rely on forces far greater than any advertising budget to build this mass desire. And then he can make those forces work for him—by directing that desire onto his particular product.

But they fall into two general categories—each presenting its distinct problem to the copy writer. Here are these two categories, with a few speci\u0016c examples of each. 1. Permanent Forces Mass Instinct. e desire of women to be attractive, or men to be virile, or men and women both to keep their health. In this case, the instinct never fades—the desire never changes. e copy writer’s problem here is not to pick out the trend—it is there for everyone to see. His job is to distinguish his product from the others that were there before it—to create a fresh appeal—to build a stronger believability—to shi desire from the ful\u0016llment oﬀered by one product to that oﬀered by another. How this is done, we shall see in a moment. A mass technological problem. Bad television reception, or corroding automobile muﬄers, or the time it takes for aspirin to bring relief. Until the problem is \u0016nally solved, the customers will buy and try—buy and try again. And here the copy writer has the same problem—to oﬀer the same claim of relief as his competitors, but oﬀer it in a new way. 2. e Forces of Change e beginning, the ful\u0016llment, and the reversal of a trend. Style. e sudden mass decision to show oﬀ a pay raise by installing a swimming pool in the back yard, instead of buying a bigger car. e horsepower appeal of the Fiies, and its sudden subordination to gas economy. Here the copy writer is dealing with the straws in the wind that may indicate a hurricane. Here he needs sensitivity, foresight, intuition. He must be able to see and catch the rising tide when it’s almost imperceptible—sense which of the several appeals that are built into his product he should stress at any particular moment, and when to shi to another—and, always, how to be there \u0016rst. Mass Education. e school primer and the movie screen. e tastes and appearances of society women, television stars, presidential candidates, trickling down to every hamlet in America. Group pressure; backyard gossip; community product pioneers. And equally important, the sum total of all advertising—in its unconscious, unplanned and overall eﬀect of multiplying people’s dreams and desires, and thus raising their standard of living. Here again the problem is timing. When does the shi become statistically signi\u0016cant? When do enough people make the change? When should the automotive powerhouse, for example, change its image to become the common man’s gas saver? e copy writer is faced with a society containing dozens—even hundreds—of these already-existing mass desires. His \u0016rst job therefore is to detect them— inventory them—chart their force and direction. is is a study that will occupy part of every working day for the rest of his life.

and the advertising message, which connects the two. e copy writer performs his work in three stages. In general, they go something like this: 1. Choose the most powerful desire that can possibly he applied to your product. Every mass desire has three vital dimensions. e \u0016rst is urgency, intensity, degree of demand to be satis\u0016ed. For example, constant arthritic pains compared to a minor headache. e second dimension is staying power, degree of repetition, the inability to become satiated. For example, raw hunger compared to a craving for gourmet foods. And the third dimension is scope—the number of people who share this desire. For example, the number of men willing to pay $10 for an automotive accessory that saves gas—as compared to those willing to pay the same price for one that merely prevents future repair bills. Every product appeals to two, three or four of these mass desires. But only one can predominate; only one can reach out through your headline to your customer. Only one is the key that unlocks the maximum economic power at the particular time your advertisement is published. Your choice among these alternate desires is the most important step you will take in writing your ad. If it is wrong, nothing else that you do in the ad will matter. is choice is embodied in your headline. It is for this reason that we spend so many chapters on headlines later on. To sum up the \u0016rst stage then, you try to choose the mass desire that gives you the most power in all three dimensions. You try to tap a single overwhelming desire existing today in the hearts and minds of millions of people who are actively seeking to satisfy it at this very moment. 2. Acknowledge that desire—reinforce it—and/or oﬀer the means to satisfy it—in a single statement in the headline of your ad. is headline is the bridge between your prospect and your product. It touches your prospect at the point of awareness that he has arrived at today. If he is aware of your product, and realizes that it can satisfy his desire, your headline starts with your product. If he is not aware of your product, but only of the desire itself, your headline starts with the desire. And, if he is not yet aware of what he really seeks, but is concerned only with a general problem, your headline starts with that problem and crystalizes it into a speci\u0016c need. In any case, your headline—though it may never mention your product—is the \u0016rst vital step in recognizing this mass desire—justifying and intensifying it—and directing its solution along one speci\u0016c path. 3.

One of them is the physical product—the steel, glass, paper or tobacco that the manufacturer has shaped into a particular pattern, of which he is justly proud. e other is the functional product—the product in action— the series of bene\u0016ts that your product performs for your consumer, and on the basis of which he buys your product. e physical product does not sell. People do not buy the steel in a car, the glass in a vase, the tobacco in a cigarette, or the paper in a book. e physical part of your product is of value only because it enables your product to do things for people. e important part of your product is what it does. e rest—the steel skeleton—the chrome or metal case that you actually deliver to your customer—is only your excuse for charging them your price. What they are really paying you for is what the product will do. No physical part of your product can ever become a headline. No one will buy the size of your client’s plant, the weight of your client’s steel, the care of your client’s construction. All these facts can only be used, later on, to document and reinforce the primary performance that you promise your reader in your headline, in the following ways: By justifying your price. is is the common-sense theory that the longer the car, the more tubes in the television set, the more stitches per inch in the suit, then the greater the number of dollars your product can command—if that product \u0016rst delivers the performance that your prospect demands. By documenting the quality of your performance. Tell your prospect the weight of steel in your car’s door, and he’s more likely to believe that your car will protect his life if he should have an accident on the highway. Tell your prospect the number of times your plant removes the impurities in your face cream, and she’s more likely to believe that your cream will remove the impurities in her skin. By assuring your prospect that that performance will continue throughout the years. Ceramic muﬄers mean no repair bills for the life of your car. Chemically-protected paper means you can hand your prize books down to your children. Quick-frozen food means you can retain taste and vitamins for months aer your purchase. By sharpening the reader’s mental picture of that performance. e Rolls-Royce must give you perfect riding silence because every metal part of the chassis is shielded from every other metal part by a protective coat of rubber. Helena Rubenstein’s new face cream must make your skin look younger because it contains the placenta of living animals.

Your product, in order to pull sales away from them, must introduce a new mechanism that performs the claim, or a new quality that assures its performance, or a new freedom from old limitations that improves the performance. is is the point of diﬀerence—oen conceived by the copy writer, and built by the manufacturer into the product at his recommendation. We shall discuss this point of diﬀerence quite thoroughly in the next few chapters. So much for the physical product. It is always subordinated to the functional product—the product in action—what the product does. It is the performance of your product, satisfying the mass desire of your market, which provides the selling power of your ad. Your \u0016rst task, then, in studying your product, is to list the number of diﬀerent performances it contains—to group these performances against the mass desires that each of them satis\u0016es—and then to feature the one performance that will harness the greatest sales power onto your product at that particular time. Take the automobile, for example. Every automobile oﬀers its prospective owner several diﬀerent and distinct sets of performances: It oﬀers him transportation. e ability to carry himself, his family, his luggage, and perhaps (in the case of station wagons) his pets and his furniture from place to place. It oﬀers him dependability. e freedom from breakdown, stalling, poor performance, repair bills, embarrassment and inconvenience. It oﬀers him economy. Inexpensive transportation: savings in both gas and oil; freedom from repair bills, seen this time from the point of view of the pocket book: durability high trade-in value, low insurance cost. It oﬀers him power. Number of horses at his command; take-oﬀ at the lights: acceleration on hills and in traﬃc; top speed, even if he never uses it. All adding up to a feeling of dominance on the highway. It oﬀers him recognition. Admiration, status, subtle and accepted bragging, envy, the feeling of having arrived. e oohs and ahhs of his neighbors, the \u0016rst ride, the very smell of a new car. It oﬀers him value. e number of feet of steel he can command for the price. High trade-in value over the years. e fact that the car can last for 100,000 miles, even if he can aﬀord to trade it in every year. It oﬀers him novelty. Power steering \u0016ve years ago—electric door locks today. ree-tone paint jobs yesterday—iridescent paints now. e thrill of being the leader, the pace-setter, the proven pioneer. And many more. Some of them hidden, never admitted, discovered only recently by motivation research. Dozens of diﬀerent performances, built into the same product, each of them reaching out and tapping a diﬀerent desire—a distinct public. And yet your ad can feature only one of these performances; can eﬀectively tap only one mass desire at a time. Your headline is limited by physical space.

indiﬀerence during that glance. If your \u0016rst thought holds him, he will read the second. If the second holds him, he will read the third. And if the third thought holds him, he will probably read through your ad. Every product gives you dozens of keys. But only one will \u0016t the lock. Your job is to \u0016nd that one dominant performance, squeeze every drop of power out of it in your presentation—and then convince your reader that that performance and that satisfaction can come only from your product. e next four chapters will show you how to locate that one dominant performance, and how to fashion it into your headline. Once you have written that headline, then even other performance contained in your product simply reinforces and documents that main appeal, in exactly the same way as the physical product facts listed above. 2 - YOUR PROSPECT’S STATE OF AWARENESS —HOW TO CAPITALIZE ON IT WHEN YOU WRITE YOUR HEADLINE You have now completed the \u0016rst two stages in writing your ad. You have de\u0016ned the mass desire that makes up your market—for example, the desire to lose weight, shared by millions of women all over America. And you have selected the one performance in your product that satis\u0016es that desire most deeply—for example, a liquid meal in a glass, delicious, \u0016lling, already measured for you… as easy and pleasant to drink as a chocolate malted. is de\u0016nition of your market, and the selection of the product performance most likely to capture that market, forms the core concept, or theme, of your ad. You now know where you are going to start—with your market; and where you are going to end—with your product. e bridge between these two—their meeting place—is your ad. Your ad always begins with your market, and leads that market inevitably into your product. e beginning of your ad—your headline—is the \u0016rst step in this process. erefore it concerns itself entirely with your market. It may never even mention your product or its performance. It is based entirely on the answer to these three questions: 1. What is the mass desire that creates this market? (Which we have already discovered.) 2. How much do these people know today about the way your product satis\u0016es this desire? (eir State of Awareness.) 3. How many other products have been presented to them before yours? (eir State of Sophistication.) e answer to question 1 gives you the nationwide force that creates your market. e answer to questions 2 and 3 gives you the location of that market in relation to your product. Your strategy for exploiting or overcoming the answers to these last two questions will give you the content of your headline. Let’s \u0016rst re-de\u0016ne the job we are going to ask our headline to do, and then see how each of these last two questions tells us what that headline should—and should not—say.

job your headline should be required to do. Actually, your headline does not need to sell at all. It does not have to mention your product. It does not even have to mention your main appeal. To demand that a headline should do any of these is to place the full selling burden on approximately 10% to 20% of the total physical space of your ad … that physical space taken up by the headline itself. Your headline has only one job—to stop your prospect and compel him to read the second sentence of your ad. In exactly the same way, your second sentence has only one job—to force him to read the third sentence of your ad. And the third sentence—and every additional sentence in your ad—has exactly the same job. It is simply common sense that the more of your story you can force your prospect to read, the more thoroughly you can sell him. To attempt to do the same selling job in ten words, instead of a hundred, or a thousand, is to shoot craps with your client’s money. You might as well buy only enough space to print your headline, and use the rest of the budget for repeat insertions. It is the copy writer’s job to force the prospect to read his client’s full story—not just a skimmed version of it. Only to prospects actively seeking the client’s speci\u0016c brand-name product, and in a case where you can oﬀer them a special price reduction, can your headline do the full selling job. To attempt a complete selling job with any other kind of headline is simply to admit defeat. What Your Prospect’s State of Awareness Demands From Your Headline We have already assumed that the only reader you are looking for is the prospect for your product. at means that he shares a de\u0016ned desire with thousands, and perhaps even millions, of other people all over America. But how much aware is that prospect of that desire? How close is it to the surface of his consciousness? Is he aware only that a problem or need exists, or is he aware if they can be satis\u0016ed? And if he is aware that a means of satisfaction exists, does he realize that it lies in your group of products, or speci\u0016cally in your product by name, or more speci\u0016cally in your product at a given price? e answer to these questions will help you determine the State of Awareness of your market—their present state of knowledge about your product and the satisfaction that your product performs. It is at this precise point of awareness that your headline begins. In its natural development, every market’s awareness passes through several stages. e more aware your market, the easier the selling job, the less you need to say.

requiring more and more creative solutions. 1. e Most Aware e customer knows of your product—knows what it does—knows he wants it. At this point, he just hasn’t gotten around to buying it yet. Your headline—in fact, your entire ad—need state little more except the name of your product and a bargain price. For example: “Revere Zomar Lens, Electric Eye Camera—Formerly $149.50—Now Only $119.95.” e remainder of the advertisement can summarize quickly the most desirable selling points. en add the name of a store, or a coupon, and close. is is the typical department store, discount store, mail-order- bargain-catalog type of advertising. It takes advantage of the full weight of all the advertising that has been done on the same product before it. Its addition—its news—is the price—or a free gi—or instant delivery—or proximity in the neighborhood. Its prospect is fully aware—he has all the information he needs. Here the copy writer is nothing more than the merchandise manager’s phrase-maker. e price is the most important part of his headline. ere is nothing creative about his job, and he should receive the lowest possible scale of pay. 2. e Customer Knows of the Product But Doesn’t Yet Want It Here, your prospect isn’t completely aware of all your product does, or isn’t convinced of how well it does it, or hasn’t yet been told how much better it does it now. Here—in the approach to this market—is the great bulk of all advertising. Here you are dealing with a product which is known—which has established a brand name—which has already linked itself with an acknowledged public desire, and has proven that it satis\u0016ed that desire. Here your headline is faced with one of seven tasks: a) To reinforce your prospects desire for your product; b) To sharpen his image of the way your product satis\u0016es that desire; c) To extend his image of where and when your product satis\u0016es that desire; d) To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your product satis\u0016es that desire; e) To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire even better; f) To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates former limitations; g) Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of that product, in order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire. In all seven cases, the approach is the same. You display the name of the product—either in the headline or in an equally large logo—and use the remainder of the headline to point out its superiority. e body of the ad is then an elaboration of that superiority—including visualization, documentation, and mechanization.

“Joy—The Costliest Perfume in the World.” YOUR PROSPECT’S STATE OF AWARENESS “Which Twin Has the Toni?” “Hair Coloring So Natural Only Her Hairdresser Knows For Sure—Miss Clairol.” SENSORY SHARPENING “Tastes like you just picked it—Dole.” “The skin YOU love to touch—Woodbury” ILLUSTRATION: (Anyone of the thousands of superb pictorial ads in the food, fashion, cosmetic, jewelry and similar industries. Perhaps best summed up by Life Saver’s classic headline, “Please don’t lick this page.”) (b) To sharpen your prospect’s image of the way your product satis\u0016es that desire (Much like the sensory sharpening illustrated above; but concentrating here on the physical product itself, or on the mechanism by which it works): “At 60 miles an hour, the loudest noise in a Rolls Royce is the electric clock.” “The amazing story of a Zippo that worked after being taken from the belly of a ﬁsh.” (c) To extend his image of where and when your product satis\u0016es that desire: “Anywhere you go. Hertz is always nearby” “Thirst knows no season”—in a winter ad, at a time when cold drinks were only consumed during the summer—Coca Cola. (d) To introduce new proof, details, documentation of how well your product satis\u0016es that desire: “9 out of 10 screen stars use Lux Toilet Soap for their priceless smooth skins.” “Jake La Motta, 160-lb ﬁghter, fails to ﬂatten Mono paper cup.” “In Boston, the #1 tea-drinking city, the #1 tea is Salada.” (e) To announce a new mechanism in that product to enable it to satisfy that desire even better: “Hoover's new invention washes ﬂoors and vacuums up the scrub water.” “Worlds only dog food that makes its own gravy—Gaines Gravy Train.” (f) To announce a new mechanism in your product that eliminates former limitations: “You breathe no dusty odors when YOU do it with Lewyt.” “A new Zenith hearing aid—inconspicuous beyond belief.” (g) Or to completely change the image or the mechanism of the product, in order to remove it from the competition of other products claiming to satisfy the same desire. Here we are dealing with the State of Sophistication of our market— the amount of exposure they have already had to similar products. Every product during its life history encounters this problem. All of Chapter 3 will be devoted to some of the approaches to its solution. We now move on to the less aware markets—with their more diﬃcult copy challenges, and their greater demand for the unprecedented. 3. How to Introduce New Products e prospect either knows, or recognizes immediately, that he wants what the product does; but he doesn’t yet know that there is a product— your product—that will do it for him. Here the problem is two-fold. First, to pinpoint the ill-de\u0016ned, as-yet- uncrystallized desire that is slowly spreading through great masses of people all over America.

Name the desire and/or its solution in your headline. Prove that that solution can be accomplished. And show that the mechanism of that accomplishment is contained in your product. However, starting with a market in this still-amorphous state of awareness, and continuing with each of the more diﬃcult challenges to come, the execution becomes more and more important than the mechanics. Here the copy writer contributes more and more to the value of the product in the public eye, and to its total volume of sales. Here the innovator comes into play. Here the ratio of salary of copy writer to production supervisor shoots up abruptly. For this is the domain of the idea man. What are the attributes he needs? First, analysis. As a copy writer you will \u0016nd it necessary to de\u0016ne the particular market most receptive to your product, its location in relation to your product in terms of awareness and sophistication, and the driving emotional forces that have created both that market and the potential for the sales of your product within it. Second, intuition, which may be described as the ability to sense a trend at its start, gauge its force and direction, determine the precise moment when it burgeons into a pro\u0016table market. And third, verbal creativity, as discussed in the next three chapters, and throughout the rest of the book. e ability to give a name to the still-unde\u0016ned. To capture a feeling, a hope, a desire, a fear in words. To create a catchword or a slogan. To focus emotion, and give it a goal. Let us see how great writers in the past have taken these amorphous desires, and brought them into razor-sharp focus in a single statement in their headline: “Light a Lucky, and you’ll never miss sweets that make you fat.” “Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hard work?” “How to win friends and inﬂuence people.” “To men who want to quit work some day.” “When doctors feel rotten—this is what they do.” “Now! Run your car without spark plugs.” “Whoever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant??” And dozens more. Here, amorphous desire has been crystallized in the headline. en sharpened and expanded in the \u0016rst few paragraphs; satis\u0016ed and documented in the body of the ad: and focused inevitably on the product throughout. Sometimes the simplest statement of the desire is the best. “How to win friends and inﬂuence people” needs no verbal twist to increase its impact. At other times, the desire itself must be reinforced by fresh proof that it can be achieved, “When doctors feel rotten—this is what they do”. Or by mystery, “Now! Run your car without spark plugs!” Or by wonderment, “Who ever heard of 17,000 blooms from a single plant?” e next two chapters will discuss, \u0016rst, the strategy of determining when to use a fresh approach; and second, how to sharpen that \u0016rst statement of desire with verbalization. 4.

desire—but a need. He recognizes the need immediately. But he doesn’t yet realize the connection between the ful\u0016llment of that need and your product. is is the problem-solving ad. It might be thought of as a special case of the desire ad mentioned above, since the technique of writing it is so similar. Here you start by naming the need and/or its solution in your headline. en dramatize the need so vividly that the prospect realizes just how badly he needs the solution. And then present your product as the inevitable solution. Again, this type of ad runs from the most naked statement of the need alone, to the most complicated verbal twists to bring it to the peak of impact. To start at the beginning, the most eﬀective possible headline for your particular problem may be as simple as this: “Corns?” Here, only the problem itself is mentioned—nothing more. Or it may be necessary to state both problem and solution immediately: “Stops maddening itch.” Many headlines in this category promise the removal of previously unconquerable limitations. ey are especially popular in catalog selling: “Lets portable transistor radios play on ordinary household current.” And many combine all three elements—the problem, its solution, and the removal of the usually expected limitations: “Shrinks hemorrhoids without surgery.” ere are headlines which promise substitutes for unpleasant or expensive tasks: “Now! A ring and piston job in a tube!” And there are headlines which promise to prevent a future problem, before it can occur: “Look, Mom! No cavities!” But many times the problem is not so clearly de\u0016ned, not so obviously on the surface. You may know the general area of the problem —for example, people’s embarrassment at speaking poor English. But you may not be sure of which avenue is the most eﬀective in reaching them. Here the emphasis of a single word—the emotional sharpening of an already easily-identi\u0016ed image—provides the answer: “Do YOU make these mistakes in English?” And, where the solution to the need has been promised before— where the direct statement of the solution has lost its force and freshness —then verbal twists are needed to restore that novelty: “How a bald-headed barber helped save my hair.” 5. How to Open Up a Completely Unaware Market And \u0016nally—the most diﬃcult. e prospect is either not aware of his desire or his need—or he won’t honestly admit it to himself without being lead into it by your ad—or the need is so general and amorphous that it resists being summed up in a single headline—or it’s a secret that just can’t be verbalized. is is the outer reach of the awareness scale. ese are the people who are still the logical prospects for your product; and yet, in their own minds, they are hundreds of miles away from accepting that product. It is your job to bridge that gap.

Each of these stages is separated from the others by a psychological wall. On one side of that wall is indiﬀerence; on the other, intense interest. A headline that works wonders in the \u0016rst stage—for example, “Dial Soap - 9c a cake!”—will fail completely when addressed to a third-stage market where your prospect doesn’t even realize that soaps can be made with built-in deodorants. And a third-stage headline—for example, “Who else wants a whiter wash with no hard work?”—will be old-hat, no-news to today’s housewife, who has been barraged by whiter- than-white advertising for twenty years. To sum up, then—a headline which will work to a market in one stage of awareness will not work to a market in another stage of awareness. Nor will it work, even to a market in which it has been successful, once that market passes on to a new stage of awareness. Most products are designed to satisfy a speci\u0016c need or desire. ey are born into markets that are at least the third or fourth stages of awareness. ey may therefore never be faced with the problem of an unaware market. However, many products actually pass out of public awareness or out of public acceptance at some time or other during their life histories. e desire they satisfy dries up, or other products serve it better, or they are branded “old-fashioned”. Again, we are dealing with a matter of statistics. When a product begins to slip … when volume falls oﬀ, even though advertising budgets are increased … when the name of the product no longer sells as much … when a direct statement of the product's function no longer sells as much … when a direct statement of the desire or the need that the product ful\u0016lls no longer sells as much—then that product needs to be reborn, and its problem is the problem of opening up an unaware market. Again, this is the most diﬃcult, the most challenging problem of all. ere are few positive milestones to guide you. But fortunately there are some completely self-evident negative rules that can eliminate many blind alleys, and set you face to face against your task. Planning a headline for a completely unaware or resistant market, then, is \u0016rst of all a process of elimination. Here are the \u0016rst paths: 1. Price means nothing to a person who does not know your product, or want your product. erefore, eliminate all mention of price, or price reduction, in your headline or prime display type. 2. e name of your product means nothing to a person who has never seen it before, and may actually damage your ad if you have had a bad model the year before, or if it is now associated with the antiquated, the unfashionable, or the unpleasant. erefore, keep your product out of the headline, and be extremely wary about breaking the mood or disguise of your ad with a prominent logo. 3.

At this stage of your market, a direct statement of what your product does, what desire it satis\u0016es, or what problem it solves, simply will not work. Your product either has not reached that direct stage, or has passed beyond it. And you cannot simply shi from one desire to another. You are not faced here with a problem of sophistication, but one of complete indiﬀerence, or unacceptability. erefore, the performance of your product, and the desire it satis\u0016es, can only be brought in later. You cannot mention them in your headline. So you cannot mention price, product, function or desire. What do you have le? Your market, of course! And the distinct possibility that by broadening your appeal beyond price, product function or speci\u0016c desire, you can reach the maximum limits of your full potential market; consolidate splinter appeals; and increase the sales of your product at a fantastic rate. Once you have accepted the challenge of writing this kind of ad, then your product and its attributes fade into the background, and you concentrate exclusively on the state of mind of your market at this particular moment. What you are doing essentially in this \u0016h stage is calling your market together in the headline of your ad. You are writing an identi\u0016cation headline. You are selling nothing, promising nothing, satisfying nothing. Instead, you are echoing an emotion, an attitude, a satisfaction that picks people out from the crowd and binds them together in a single statement. In this type of headline, you are telling them what they are. You are de\u0016ning them for themselves. You are giving them the information they need and want, about a problem still so vague that you are the \u0016rst to put it into words. Here, above all, is the type of headline that never attempts to sell a product or a performance, but simply tries to sell the remainder of the ad itself—the information that follows on the page. e only function of this headline is to get the prospect to read the next paragraph. And this second paragraph pulls him into the third; and the third into the fourth: and right on down the page, paragraph aer paragraph. Meanwhile these paragraphs are building a steady progression of logical images, from the \u0016rst identi\u0016cation with the headline, to a growing awareness of the problem or the desire to the realization that a solution is at hand, and to the inevitable focusing of that desire and that solution onto your particular product. is, then, is the general strategy of dealing with an unaware market. e application of this strategy, when all direct methods have failed, has produced hundreds of great headlines. It would be impossible to classify all of them, since each solution establishes its own new pattern. However, there are de\u0016nite landmarks and directions we can distinguish.

Giving Words to a Hidden Dream Problem: to expand the market for home correspondence courses beyond that obtained by “Earn more money” and “Gain more skill” headlines. e solution: THE UNIVERSITY OF THE NIGHT The young Lincoln, poring over borrowed school- books far into the night—seeking in the dim light of his log ﬁre the transforming light of knowledge—eager to grow— eager to do … here is an example which has inspired the man who strives against the odds of circumstances to make his place in the world. Tonight, in cities and towns and villages … thousands of men will drop their daily labors to ﬁght, beneath the lamp, the battle that Lincoln fought… Up from the mines, down from the masts of ships … from all the places where men work, they will go home and take up their books because they yearn to grow, because they seek higher training, greater skill, more responsibility … Some of them are men who work in one ﬁeld whereas their talents and desires are in another. Some … are halted in their progress because they do not understand the higher principles of their business or profession. Some left school in boyhood because poverty made it necessary … Fifty years ago these men … would have had no place to turn for the courses of study and for the personal guidance that they need. Thirty years ago there was founded a school to help them—a school created for their needs and circumstances —a school that goes to them no matter where they are—a school… Created in response to a need, the International Correspondence Schools have developed their scope and usefulness to the growth of that need … Exploiting a Hidden Fear Problem: To re-vitalize the sales of a coﬀee substitute, long aer health headlines and pep headlines and taste headlines had failed. Secondary problem: To overcome a slipping brand name, that was no longer an asset in either the headline or the logo. e solution: WHY MEN CRACK… An authority of international standing recently wrote; “You have overeaten and plugged your organs with moderate stimulants, the worst of which are not only alcohol and tobacco, but caﬀeine and sugar …” You know them. Strong men, vigorous men, robust men—men who have never had a sick day in their lives. They drive. They drive themselves to the limit. They lash themselves over the limit with stimulants. They crack. Often, they crash. You have seen them afterwards. Pitiful shells. The zest gone, the ﬁre gone. Burnt-out furnaces of energy. “He was such a healthy-looking man…” He was. His health was his undoing. His constitution absorbed punishment. Otherwise he might have been warned in time. “For every action there is an equal and contrary reaction.” You learned the law in physics. It applies to bodies.

What is good for the boy is good for the man… Borrowed Energy Must Be Repaid! Two million American families avoid caﬀeine by drinking Postum. And two million American families are better oﬀ for it… Leading Into an Unacceptable Problem by Starting With a Universally Accepted Image Problem: To gain both publisher and prospect acceptance for a woman’s deodorant. A direct statement of the performance or product would not only oﬀend, but would never be published. e solution: WITHIN THE CURVE OF A WOMAN’S ARM A frank discussion of a subject too often avoided. A woman’s arm! Poets have sung of its grace; artists have painted its beauty. It should be the daintiest, sweetest thing in the world. And yet, unfortunately, it isn’t, always. There’s an old oﬀender in this quest for perfect daintiness—an oﬀender of which we ourselves may be ever so unconscious, but which is just as truly present. Shall we discuss it frankly? Many a woman who says, “No, I am never annoyed by perspiration,” does not know the facts … Of course, we aren’t to blame because nature has made us so that the perspiration glands under the arms are more active than anywhere else.

To meet this need, a physician formulated Odorono—a perfectly harmless and delightful toilet water… To Project a Hidden Desire Which Cannot Be Put Bluntly Into Words Problem: To capitalize on research \u0016ndings that smoking cigarettes gives men a feeling of virility, importance, sexual strength. Any verbal expression of these themes, however, would be instantly rejected as absurd and oﬀensive. e solution: e MARLBORO TATTOO AD: With its virile men (cowboys, racing car drivers, sky divers, etc.) whose appearance alone projected more of an image of raw virility than any number of words could ever convey. Using a Common Resentment or Unvoiced Protest to Capture a Far Greater Market than the Direct Statement of the Solution of at Resentment Would Produce Problem: To sell a do-it-yourself book on television repairs.

broadened to include the non-handymen owners, by exploiting the existing resentment against TV service contracts. e solution: WHY HAVEN’T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947? Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60 a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you’ve dreamed about! How many times this week have you had to get up to ﬁx a jumpy TV picture? … How many times have you had to put up with ghosts? … 90% of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary! All these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to you at the moment they happened—but here is the real tragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you now have in your front room … has been playing in manufacturer’s test rooms for months—and playing perfectly! These sets have been subjected to “Breakdown Tests” … These sets have been tested against every conceivable type of viewing hazard … And, in almost every one of these cases, these sets have produced perfect, movie clear pictures, without major breakdowns, for as much as one full year! Here are some of the reasons why: What TV Experts Have Learned About Your Set. If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were … it need break down only once during the entire year… If your set were properly cared for, it can actually give you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days of the year… And most important, these experts have discovered that you do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance… Here’s why: 5 Minutes a Week for Perfect Reception. These TV experts have discovered that your TV set is a great deal like your body in this respect—that it gives warning signals before it has a major breakdown… Now, if you had the knowledge to make a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of that set, then you could correct those symptoms… If you do not have this knowledge … then your set will weaken, you will have a constantly bad picture… It’s as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge. If you had that knowledge yourself—then you would not have to pay him at all… Now suppose that you had a TV expert at your elbow 24 hours a day.

THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO. BUT WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY!— Arthur had just played “The Rosary.” The room rang with applause. I decided that this would be a dramatic moment for me to make my debut. To the amazement of all my friends, I strode conﬁdently over to the piano and sat down. “Jack is up to his old tricks,” somebody chuckled. The crowd laughed … “Can he really play?” I heard a girl whisper to Arthur. “Heavens, no!” Arthur exclaimed. “He never played a note in his life. But you just watch him. This is going to be good.” … Then I Started to Play. Instantly a tense silence fell on the guests. The laughter died on their lips as if by magic … I heard gasps of amazement. My friends sat breathless—spellbound. I played on and on and as I played I forgot the people around me. I forgot the hour, the place, the breathless listeners. The little world I lived in seemed to fade— seemed to grow dim—unreal. Only the music was real … It seemed as if the master musician himself were speaking to me … not in words but in chords. Not in sentences but in exquisite melodies! A Complete Triumph! As the last notes of the Moonlight Sonata died away, the room resounded with a sudden roar of applause. I found myself surrounded by excited faces. How my friends carried on! Men shook me by the hand—wildly congratulated me—pounded me on the back with their enthusiasm! Everybody was exclaiming with delight— plying me with rapid questions … “Jack! Why didn’t you tell us you could play like that?” … “Where did you learn?” … “How long have you studied?” … “Who was your teacher?” “I have never even seen my teacher,” I replied. “And just a short while ago I couldn’t even play a note.” “Quit your kidding,” laughed Arthur, himself an accomplished pianist. “You’ve been studying for years. I can tell.” “I have been studying only a short while,” I insisted. “I decided to keep it a secret so I could surprise all you folks.” Then I told them the whole story “Have you ever heard of the U.S. School of Music?” A few of my friends nodded. “That’s a correspondence school, isn’t it?” they exclaimed. “Exactly,” I replied. “They have a new simpliﬁed method that can teach you to play any

social-oﬀense theme, which would be rejected in its direct form. e idea of bad breath was too insulting to be taken by the public “straight.” e solution: OFTEN A BRIDESMAID BUT NEVER A BRIDE Edna’s case was really a pathetic one. Like every woman, her primary ambition was to marry. Most of the girls in her set were married—or about to be. Yet no one possessed more charm or grace or loveliness than she. And as her birthdays crept gradually toward that tragic thirty-mark, marriage seemed farther from her life than ever. She was often a bridesmaid but never a bride. That’s the insidious thing about halitosis (unpleasant breath). You, yourself rarely know when you have it. And even your closest friends won’t tell you. Sometimes, of course, halitosis comes from some deep-seated organic disorder that requires professional advice. But usually—and fortunately—halitosis is only a local condition that yields to the regular use of Listerine as a mouth wash and gargle. It is an interesting thing that this well-known antiseptic that has been in use for years for surgical dressings, possesses these unusual properties as a breath deodorant… Projecting the Result of an Accomplishment to Attract People Who Would Be Frightened Away by the Work Implied to Achieve It Problem: To broaden the market for home correspondence courses, beyond that possible with a direct statement of the immediate result— learning or skill. An attempt must be made to direct the prospect’s mind away from eﬀort, to reward. e solution: HERE’S AN EXTRA $50, GRACE— “I’m making real money now!” “Yes, I’ve been keeping it a secret until pay day came. I’ve been promoted with an increase of $50 a month. And the ﬁrst extra money is yours. Just a little reward for urging me to study at home. The boss saw my spare time training has made me a valuable man to the ﬁrm and there’s more money coming soon. We’re starting up easy street, Grace, thanks to you and the I.C.S…” e List Never Ends Every day new solutions, new patterns are being created. Wherever the direct appeal fails, or loses its power, you should begin to explore a \u0016h stage headline. However, there are two vital points to remember in connection with this problem. First of all, this type of headline is in\u0016nitely more diﬃcult to bring home to the target than any of the other four types. You are far more likely to miss the mark on this headline, because you have far fewer guideposts to direct you. Your headline no longer refers to your product, but it must therefore refer even more strongly to your market. It cannot simply be a startler, or an attention-getter, or humorous, or cute. Nor can it mask the fact that it has no headline behind a pretty picture.

cardinal rule in mind. Your prospect must identify with your headline before he can buy from it. It must be his headline, his problem, his state of mind at that particular moment. It must pick out the product’s logical prospects—and reject as many people as it attracts. And, if it is an eﬀective headline, and it works, then it too will become outdated as your market moves on to a new stage of awareness. And you will be presented with another problem, just as challenging, and just as rewarding, as the one you have solved before. You never step in the same river twice. No market ever stands still. A Final Word on Style in Advertising Copy Markets change; desires change; fashions change. And so do the acceptable styles of advertisements change. Certain advertising styles— the form your advertising message takes—grow tired with time—then stale—then actually laughable. At the turn of the century, eﬀective ads were written in verse; twenty years later, no one would believe them. In the 1920s most of the great ads were narrative stories—either \u0016rst-person confessions, or third person revelations, or comic strips dramatizations. Today everything but the comic strip is gone—and we see less and less of it every year. When a new style is born, people believe it, and it reinforces the message it is carrying. When that same style grows trite, people cannot see the message for the advertisement. We’ll explore this subject further, in the chapters discussing Mood and Disguise in writing advertisements. Meanwhile, one more note here. In eﬀective advertising, though styles may change, strategy does not. If you will study the piano and bridesmaid ads in this chapter, you will notice this: at while the narrative style of both is now old-hat, you can still respond to their power. Both tap desires that still exist—though now perhaps directed toward diﬀerent products and diﬀerent problems. And both evoke those desires, and channel those desires, so eﬀectively, that if they were rewritten in today’s idiom, and applied to diﬀerent products, they still might sell millions of dollars’ worth of goods today. 3 - THE SOPHISTICATION OF YOUR MARKET: HOW MANY PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU? As we mentioned before, in Chapter 2, there are three questions you must answer before you can determine what goes into your headline. ese are: 1. What is the mass desire that motivates your market? 2. How much does your market know about your product? (eir State of Awareness.) 3. How many similar products have they been told about before? (eir State of Sophistication.) is third question is the most easily answered. A few hours research should give you samples of every competing ad in the \u0016eld—if there are any.

In other words, they have never received any information about such a product before. Once you get them interested, they are likely to become much more enthusiastic, believe much more of what you have to say, and buy that much more readily. Remember, your story is brand-new to them. is, of course, is the dream of every manufacturer and every copy writer. To be \u0016rst. And it happens quite oen today. Sometimes because of a technological breakthrough—creating a new product (women’s hair sprays), or a radically better product (long-playing records), or a familiar product at an explosively low price (the Model T Ford). And sometimes, such a brand-new market is created by the insight of an advertising man, dealing with an already-established product. In this case, the ad man visualizes the application of the product to an entirely diﬀerent market (the switch, in the Twenties, of Ovaltine from an aid for insomnia to a body builder for skinny children). Or he reaches that market through a hitherto untapped medium (Revlon’s fabulous results from sponsorship of “e $64,000 Question” in the early days of TV). Or he discovers a previously unnoticed performance of his product that carries it completely beyond the limits of its old market (Lifebuoy’s discovery that people would accept its strong medicinal odor as a cure for perspiration odor, and their subsequent christening of that odor with the catch-word “B.O.”). When such a golden opportunity—to be \u0016rst—presents itself, you are probably dealing with a market in its third or fourth stage of awareness. Your prospects know that they would like what your product does, or they would like to get rid of the problem your product solves—if it were only possible. Here, the answer to your third question is quite simple. You are dealing with a market where you are \u0016rst. erefore they have no previous information about similar products. erefore they are completely unsophisticated. And your exploitation of this answer—your strategy in approaching this market—is equally simple: 1. Be simple. Be direct. Above all, don’t be fancy. Name either the need or the claim in your headline—nothing more. Dramatize that claim in your copy—make it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and prove that it works. Nothing more—because nothing more is needed. To illustrate, let’s look at one of the most pro\u0016table, insatiable, constantly-renewing, and therefore overworked \u0016elds in marketing history: the reducing \u0016eld. No one knows who was the \u0016rst man to stumble on the reducing \u0016eld (though it’s fairly certain that he must have become a millionaire). But all he had to say in his headline was a simple statement of the direct desire of millions of women: “NOW! LOSE UGLY FAT!” As he started to clean up, others inevitably followed.

A new approach was necessary. e strategy had to be changed—to this: If You’re Second, Do is If you’re second, and the direct claim is still working—then copy that successful claim—but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit. Outbid your competition. For example, here are two successful headlines in the now \u0016ercely- competitive reducing \u0016eld that did just that. ey have both been pushed to the outer limits of both legality and believability. But they both worked. “LOSE UP TO 47 POUNDS IN 4 WEEKS—OR RECEIVE $40 BACK!” “I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER … NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.” In most \u0016elds, this enlarged-claim technique reaches the outer limits in successive stages. Sometimes the completion of this process takes years. In the home garden \u0016eld, as another example, an advertiser brought out a Floribunda Rose—using this headline with startling success: “PICK 25—50—100 ROSES FROM THIS ONE MAGNIFICENT PLANT!” It worked. And so, some years later, a special variety of cushion mum swept the country with this headline: “SIX HUNDRED MUMS FROM A SINGLE BUSH!” And, one year later, this headline carried the process to what are probably the absolute limits of Mother Nature: “WHO EVER HEARD OF 17,000 BLOOMS FROM A SINGLE PLANT?” As simple as this evolution looks, it produces results. It provided a tremendous li to car sales in the 1950s, when 50 more horsepower was added to the advertisements every year. It was climaxed in the Chrysler 300—a car named aer its horsepower rating—and pegged just at the limit of believability, practicality, and the inevitable public reaction. For the reaction will come. Toward the end, the process disintegrates. e successful claim is overworked; enlargement piles on enlargement. New competitors enter the \u0016eld—each trying to promise more. Headlines double and triple in size. Words begin to lose their meaning—“whiter- than-whites” appear. e prospect becomes confused—then skeptical. Believability is shattered; claims are automatically discounted 50% by their readers. More promise is poured in to compensate. e government begins to investigate. And the sales curve begins to turn down-down- down. e ird Stage of Sophistication At this point, your market has entered into its ird Stage of Sophistication. Your prospects have now heard all the claims—all the extremes. Perhaps they have even bought one or two competitive products. Every time they open a newspaper, another similar headline screams out at them. How are they to distinguish one product from the mass? How do you break through to reach them? One factor is vital here. at is the restorative power of the market you are dealing with. It may be a market based on a constantly recurring mass instinct, such as reducing. It may be a market based on an unsolved technological problem, such as spark plug replacement. It may be a market that periodically wishes to renew or improve its purchases, such as cars, homes, appliances. In all these cases, the desire never fades; the market continually renews itself.

Old customers become dissatis\u0016ed with their old purchases, their old solutions, and begin to look again. e mass desire—the tremendous pro\u0016t potential—still exists. But it cannot be tapped by the old, simple methods any longer. Women still want to lose weight. But by now they’ve read dozens of ads for reducing aids—all promising them to take oﬀ 20, 30, 40 pounds in a matter of weeks. ey no longer fully believe them. Perhaps they believe these ads so little that they won’t even try a new product at all. For months, even years, they may simply accept their overweight condition as “something that just can’t be helped.” But the desire never fades. e dissatisfaction builds up, month aer month. Secretly, perhaps even unconsciously, these women are hoping to \u0016nd a new product—a new headline—that promises them a new way to satisfy that age-old desire. And on this fundamental fact, we build our strategy for selling a market in its ird Stage of Sophistication. If your market is at the stage where they’ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won’t work any longer. What this market needs now is a new device to make all these old claims become fresh and believable to them again. In other words, A NEW MECHANISM—a new way to making the old promise work. A diﬀerent process—a fresh chance—a brand-new possibility of success where only disappointment has resulted before. Here the emphasis shis from what the product does to HOW it works. Not accomplishment, but performance becomes dominant. e headline expands. e claim remains—but now it is reinforced by the mechanism that accomplishes it. In the reducing \u0016eld, for example, the limits of its basic promise had been reached by headlines like this: “I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER … NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.” Now new leaders emerge—avoiding the competition of claims— stressing mechanism instead, like this: “FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!” “FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!” A vital change has taken place in both these ads—and in every ad that deals successfully with this ird Stage of Sophistication. In the previous, Second-Stage ads, the entire headline was taken up by a complete statement of the main claim. Below it, in smaller type, in either a subhead or the body copy, came the mechanism that accomplished the claim. Oen, this mechanism was abbreviated—simply mentioned instead of being explained—indicated by a sort of shorthand, like this: “I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER … NEVER A HUNGRY MINUTE.” Read the Astonishing Experience of New York Food Expert with the Famous Eat-and-Reduce Plan. In ird-Stage ads, however, this arrangement is completely reversed. By this time, the basic claim has become well-known to almost all its prospects—perhaps even too well-known. erefore, this shorthand can be applied to the claim itself.

For instance: “FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!” Or: “FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!” First the mechanism is brought into the headline to establish a point of diﬀerence—to make the old claims fresh and believable again. And then—once the prospect is told that here is a brand-new chance for success—then the claim can he restated in full, to make sure that she realizes everything she is getting. Like this: “FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY!” Released for the ﬁrst time! The amazing scientiﬁc discovery that melts up to 37 POUNDS oﬀ men and women—without starvation diets, without a single hungry moment—without even giving up the foods you love! Or—using the same ird-Stage arrangement of mechanism in the headline, and claim elaborated in the lead paragraph—we have this ad: “FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING!” Used successfully by thousands of physicians! Lose as many pounds as you like without diets, without exercise, without giving up the kinds of food you love to eat! In both these ads—and all others like them—the promise itself is subordinated to the mechanism which accomplishes that promise. is mechanism is featured in the headline. When ads such as these are successful, you are dealing with a market that is in its ird Stage of Sophistication. e Fourth Stage But you are still in a competitive market, and such ads give only a temporary advantage. Such ads, presenting a new promise, begin a new trend. Within a few months, the ird Stage of Sophistication passes into a Fourth Stage—a new stage of elaboration and enlargement. But this time, the elaboration is concentrated on the mechanism, rather than on the promise—like this: “FIRST NO-DIET REDUCING WONDER DRUG!” is Fourth Stage strategy can be summarized like this: If a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that new mechanism announcement is producing sales, then you counter in this way. Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism. Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise extra bene\u0016ts. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar to the Second Stage of Sophistication described above. e same strategy will be eﬀective here. But, unfortunately, so will the same limitations. e Fourth Stage of Sophistication, like the Second Stage which it resembles, eventually pushes itself out of the realm of believability. At this point, further elaborations become ineﬀective. You are then faced with two alternatives: First, discovering a new, acceptable mechanism to make the promise fresh and believable again. But remember, the mechanism you use must not only be new and legitimate, but it must be accepted as believable and signi\u0016cant by your market. Each ird and Fourth Stage ad that precedes you, makes this problem of acceptance more and more diﬃcult.

Your prospects will have been glutted by advertising. You will have reached the Fih Stage of Sophistication—the most diﬃcult—where the \u0016eld is said to be exhausted—where competitors are dropping out of the market en masse. How to Revive a “Dead” Product In this Final Stage of Sophistication, your market no longer believes in your advertising, and therefore no longer wishes to be aware of your product. In many ways, therefore, this Fih Stage of Sophistication corresponds to the Fih Stage of Awareness discussed in Chapter 2. e problems are the same. e strategy is the same. e emphasis shis from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identi\u0016cation with the prospect himself. You are dealing here with the problem of bringing your prospect into your ad—not through desire—but through identi\u0016cation. (See Chapter 8.) An outstanding example of a product which had lost its market because of such a Fih Stage of Sophistication, and then gained it back by a brilliant use of the identi\u0016cation headline, is the Postum ad discussed in Chapter 2, and its headline, “WHY MEN CRACK …” Let’s Look at an Industry at Went rough All Five Stages of Sophistication But perhaps the classic example of an industry which encountered all \u0016ve Stages of Sophistication—and overcame them—is the Cigarette Industry. e history of cigarette advertising is a continuous battle against competition, against physical and social taboos, even against the very success of its own current advertising; which saturates and exhausts the market by the weight of its combined industry expenditures, and constantly demands new approaches. Let’s brie\u0019y examine the main current of cigarette advertising \u0016rst— the progression from the \u0016rst to the \u0016h Stages of Sophistication—and then discuss some of the side problems it encountered. In the First Stage of Sophistication, when the market was new, cigarette advertising featured taste, enjoyment, pleasure in the headline: “I’D WALK A MILE FOR A CAMEL!” “CHESTERFIELD—THEY SATISFY!” is raw promise of enjoyment gradually became elaborated and embellished to push it to the limits of believability. In this Second Stage, since you cannot measure the pleasure a cigarette gives you, the promise- growth took the form of broader and broader comparisons: “LIGHT UP A LUCKY, AND YOU WONT MISS THE SWEETS THAT MAKE YOU FAT!” But, without measurement, the limits of enlargement are soon reached. So ird-Stage strategy began to be employed—a continuous stream of brilliant new mechanisms: “LUCKIES—THEY’RE TOASTED!” “PALL MALL’S GREATER LENGTH FILTERS THE SMOKE FURTHER!” “CAMELS—PROTECT YOUR T-ZONE!” And, as each of these mechanisms was accepted by the buying public, the originators competitors adopted the mechanism and began to elaborate on it—initiating the Fourth Stage: “PHILIP MORRIS—ALL THE HARSHNESS BAKED OUT!” “CHESTERFIELD—REGULAR AND KING-SIZED TOO!” “NINE OUT OF TEN DOCTORS PREFER LUCKIES!” But eventually the mechanisms lost their potency, and the government ruled out the health claims; and in the early Fiies the industry faced a Fih Stage market.

simply by projecting strong visual identi\u0016cations with the virility that the public had accepted in a cigarette. For example, any of the Marlboro “Virile Men” ads. Or their imitations in Chester\u0016eld, or Camel ads. us we have the full spectrum of sophistication confronting an industry. But cigarette advertisers also encountered two critical side problems. e \u0016rst oﬀered them the opportunity of doubling their market. e second, of retaining that huge market in the face of the most adverse publicity e \u0016rst challenge occurred immediately following the First World War. By this time the old “Coﬃn Nails” taboo had been forgotten—for men. But there still remained the equally great potential market of women smokers—if smoking could be made respectable for women. e trend was de\u0016nitely in that direction—the urge, the curiosity existed in millions of women in all social classes—some respectable women were actually daring to smoke in public. But the trend—le by itself—would take years to develop. An advertisement had to be created to accelerate that trend. To make smoking for women not only acceptable, but desirable. To channel the vast movement toward liberation and equality of the Twenties as the driving force to open up this huge new market. But such an advertisement could never come right out and suggest that women smoke. It could not even show a woman smoking. Such an advertisement was de\u0016nitely a Fih Stage problem—a problem in identi\u0016cation. And it was solved by linking a man and woman in their most appealing connection—in love—with a smoking situation. e ad showed a young couple, sitting together on a beach on a moonlit night. He is just lighting up a cigarette—the \u0016rst puﬀs of smoke are just driing into the moonlight. She has her face turned toward his, and her words make up the entire headline (and, except for the logo, the entire ad): “BLOW SOME MY WAY.” Nothing more needed to be said. A vast new market—opened up with four words. e second challenge occurred thirty years later. is was the cancer of the late Fiies, which continues into today. It resulted in four reactions: First, there were cigarette holders, water pipes, ceramic \u0016lters, etc.—none of which succeeded in establishing a national market, since they represented too much inconvenience, too blatant an admission that the purchaser was worried about his smoking. Secondly, the scare produced a determined eﬀort in the industry itself to conduct its own research, to counteract or correct such claims. ird, it produced a temporary drop in cigarette sales. And, fourth, it opened up a vast new market for an already existing product—the \u0016lter cigarette—aided by the industry itself, which wisely gambled that smokers would not move out of cigarettes, but simply into a diﬀerent kind of cigarette. Filter cigarettes had always existed, as a small, specialty market. But now they were expanded into a mass market.

A Personal Note In this book I have tried to write a scienti\u0016c study of advertising, without troubling the reader with whatever personal ethics I myself may observe. Every copy writer who has ever sweated for days to create a new approach will know how it feels to see that approach copied overnight by a competitor. I share every ounce of that feeling. But such events happen every day. And they are eﬀective. erefore, examples such as those detailed above must be listed, in all objectivity, as a business strategy that has and will solve competitive problems in a competitive industry. I include them here—not as recommendations, but as possible strategies to be chosen or rejected. 4 - 38 WAYS TO STRENGTHEN YOUR HEADLINE ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR BASIC IDEA Up to this point, we have been concerned with the strategy of planning copy—of arriving at the theme of our ad and the content of its headline—rather than with the techniques of actually writing this copy. e entire second portion of the book will be devoted to these techniques. But we must pause now, and examine one of these techniques out of sequence. It is called VERBALIZATION. And it is the art of increasing the impact of a headline by the way in which it is stated. Everything we have done so far has helped us obtain the content of our headline. We now know what we want to say. And we now have to determine how to say it. e most obvious way, of course, is simply to state the claim in its barest form. “Lose Weight,” or “Stop Corns,” for example. And if you are the \u0016rst in your \u0016eld, there is no better way. But where you are competitive, or where the thought is too complicated to be stated simply and directly, then you must reinforce that claim by binding other images to it with the words in which you express it. is is Verbalization.

diﬀerent angle, turning it into a narration, challenging the reader with an example, etc. 3. It can help the claim pull the prospect into the body of the ad—by promising him information about it, by questioning him, by partially revealing mechanism, etc. All of these goals are accomplished by adding variations, enlargements or embellishments to the main headline claim of the ad. ese additional images are bound into the main claim by the sentence structure of the headline. ey alter the main claim to make it more eﬀective. ey are the second creative step in writing the ad. First, we have seen how to determine the appeal itself. And now, how to shape that appeal into its most eﬀective form in the headline. ere are, of course, an in\u0016nite number of these variations (every good copywriter invents a few himself). But there are general patterns that most of them follow. Here are some of these guideposts for your own thinking: 1. Measure the size of the claim: “20,000 FILTER TRAPS IN VICEROY!” “I AM 61 POUNDS LIGHTER …” ‘WHO EVER HEARD OF 17,000 BLOOMS FROM A SINGLE PLANT?” 2. Measure the speed of the claim: “FEEL BETTER FAST!” “IN TWO SECONDS, BAYER ASPIRIN BEGINS TO DISSOLVE IN YOUR GLASS!’“ 3. Compare the claim: “SIX TIMES WHITER WASHES!” “COSTS UP TO $300 LESS THAN MANY MODELS OF THE LOW- PRICED THREE!” 4. Metaphorize the claim: “BANISHES CORNS!” “MELTS AWAY UGLY FAT!” 5. Sensitize the claim by making the prospect feel, smell, touch, see or hear it: “TASTES LIKE YOU JUST PICKED IT!” “THE SKIN YOU LOVE TO TOUCH!” 6. Demonstrate the claim by showing a prime example: “JAKE LAMOTTA, 160 POUND FIGHTER, FAILS TO FLATTEN MONO PAPER CUP!” “AT 60 MILES AN HOUR, THE LOUDEST NOISE IN THIS ROLLS ROYCE IS THE ELECTRIC CLOCK!” 7. Dramatize the claim, or its result: “HERE’S AN EXTRA $50, GRACE—I’M MAKING BIG MONEY NOW!” “THEY LAUGHED WHEN I SAT DOWN AT THE PIANO—BUT WHEN I STARTED TO PLAY …” 8. State the claim as a paradox: “HOW A BALD-HEADED BARBER SAVED MY HAIR!” “BEAT THE RACES BY PICKING LOSERS!” 9. Remove limitations from the claim: “SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY!” “YOU BREATHE NO DUSTY ODORS WHEN YOU DO IT WITH LEWYT!” 10. Associate the claim with values or people with whom the prospect wishes to be identi\u0016ed: “MICKEY MANTLE SAYS: CAMELS NEVER BOTHER MY THROAT!” “9 OUT OF 10 DECORATORS USE WUNDA-WEAVE CARPETS FOR LONG LIFE AT LOW COST!” 11. Show how much work, in detail, the claim does: “NOW! RELIEF FROM ALL 5 ACID-CAUSED STOMACH TROUBLES—IN SECONDS!” “RELIEVES CONGESTION IN ALL 7 NASAL PASSAGES INSTANTLY!” 12.

Tie authority into the claim: “BOSS MECHANIC SHOWS HOW TO AVOID ENGINE REPAIR BILLS!” “HERE’S WHAT DOCTORS DO WHEN THEY FEEL ROTTEN!” 15. Before-and-aer the claim: “BEFORE COLDENE A CHILD GOT OVER A COLD AFTER 5 DAYS OF ACHING, SNEEZING, WHEEZING, DRIPPING, SUFFERING, COUGHING, CRYING, GAGGING, SPITTING.” “WITH COLDENE A CHILD GETS OVER A COLD IN FIVE DAYS!” 16. Stress the newness of the claim: “ANNOUNCING! GUIDED MISSILE SPARK PLUGS!” “NOW! CHROME PLATE WITHOUT HEAT, ELECTRICITY, MACHINERY!” 17. Stress the exclusivity of the claim: “OURS ALONE! PERSIAN LAMB ORIGINALS—$389.40!” “ONLY GLEEM HAS GL-70 TO KEEP TEETH CLEAN ALL DAY LONG WITH ONE BRUSHING!” 18. Turn the claim into a challenge for the reader: “WHICH TWIN HAS THE TONI?

State the claim as a case-history quotation: “LOOK, MOM—NO CAVITIES!” “WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT—I HAVE A COLD!” 20. Condense the claim—interchange your product and the product it replaces: “NOW! A RING AND PISTON JOB IN A TUBE!” “POUR YOURSELF A NEW ENGINE!” 21.

Show how easy the claim is to accomplish by imposing a universally-overcome limitation: “IF YOU CAN COUNT TO ELEVEN, YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR SPEED AND SKILL AT NUMBERS!” 31.

As far as I can tell, there are three of them: e \u0016rst, the shallowest, and the most widespread and ineﬀective, is the Word-Substitute Technique. Here the copy writer consults a list of proven and successful headlines. He then pulls out the original product name and substitutes his own; or his own product’s performance, etc. He usually comes up with something like this: “I’D WALK A MILE FOR A CUP OF BLANK COFFEE!” “WHY HAVEN’T BOAT OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?” “FLOATS UGLY PIMPLES RIGHT OUT OF YOUR SKIN!” If these ads are copied from a similar product, in the same market, at the same time, then their chance of success is good—especially if they embellish the promise in any way. But if the product, or the market, or the timing is diﬀerent, then the chances of success diminish proportionately. ey become Echo Ads—ads that remind people of some other product. ey pay no attention to unique product-market- timing relationship that exists at the moment. erefore they lose all the strengths that are wrapped up in that relationship. ey are the kind of ads that clients write, rather than copy writers. e second, deeper and more diﬃcult approach is through formulas. Here the copy writer has memorized a list of rules or principles, and tries to pour his headline into them like he’d pour hot lead into a mold. Such rules usually concern the way a headline is expressed. ey list methods of strengthening the verbalization of the headline idea, and here they have a perfectly-valid use. Several examples of these principles are given in Chapter 4. But the idea for an ad or a headline demands its own shape. It cannot be \u0016tted into someone else’s solution. e problem de\u0016es a formula. And the third, analytical approach that we have outlined above—with no answers; only guide-posts and questions—oﬀers the only way. is is a hard fact to accept.

which has done its job perfectly —can be used only once. It means that there are no creative shortcuts— that the eﬀort must be duplicated with each individual ad. But fortunately the techniques of probing can be learned and perfected; intuition can be sharpened; a sensitivity can be developed for picking out the vital fact from a maze of information. And, of course, abandoning this eﬀort leads to a reality which is even harsher. Many copy writers grow old, or tired, or afraid. ey stop searching for the unique solution in every problem. From this moment on, they begin to copy instead of create. And most pathetic of all, many begin to copy themselves. e more successful the copy writer, the greater the temptation to \u0016nd his new headline in his old \u0016les. But it won’t work. Copying can be done by any cub. All this process does is bring talent down to the level of \u0016le-cabinet mediocrity. e true copy writer must argue with success—he must push on past it every time he faces a new product. In advertising, as well as in science and in art, the solution to the unique lies only in itself. On Motivation Research and Its Relation to the Copy Writer As we have repeated throughout this \u0016rst part of the book, the copy writer’s primary job is to know his market. Many times, he has to know more about that market than the market knows about itself. Before MR (Motivation Research), he did this mostly by personal digging, reading, talking—and guessing. With MR, he has some pretty professional guessers working with him. And they have the equipment to prove their guesses far more easily and inexpensively than writing a campaign and testing it. e copy writer can use MR in two ways. It can be a tremendous source of information to him. Information about the most powerful needs and desires of his market—desires that may be hidden, verbally unacceptable, or completely unknown. It shows him the strength of those desires—their dri and momentum—the taboos that accompany them, and limit their expression. It helps him locate splits in his market—gauge their points of diﬀerence—design pinpoint appeals for each of them. And it feeds back to him early reactions to his own phraseology—to test his own worry-points in the ad—to enable him to shi emphasis—and even to emerge with a completely new idea. All well and good. But a motivation research \u0016nding is not a headline, nor even the central theme of an ad, nor will it ever be. Like any other fact, it is a direction. First it tells you where not to go, to avoid wasting your time. And then it indicates the general area of your solution.

e copy writer has to take it from there. e second great service that MR can perform for the copy writer is that of testing his own hunches, in answering the questions he uncovers in dealing with his market over a period of time. For purposes of simplicity, we have dealt with advertising strategy as though it always consisted of writing a single ad—rather than a continuous campaign. By limiting ourselves in this way, we have been able to deal with each of the phases of such a campaign as though it were a separate and distinct problem, requiring a separate and distinct advertisement to solve it. In doing this, we have emphasized that a breakthrough can occur at any stage of a campaign; and that the same breakthrough techniques can be used to produce the germ idea for the entire campaign that follows. In reality, however, the copy writer usually works on a given product, or in a given market area, for long periods of time. During that time he will write many ads on this same subject. And during that time he will engage in a kind of discourse with his market, in which he feeds that market ideas, and it feeds back to him reactions to those ideas. During this massive conversation, if he is sensitive, the copy writer will pick up a continuous \u0019ow of the most vital information. Some of this information will be actual trends and preferences, which can be immediately translated into new ads. But much more of it will be in negative form—failures, roadblocks, limitations to the response from his ads. And only the statistical measurements of these limitations will be shown—not their causes. e copywriter will want to know why they occur. And in asking why, he will give birth to questions like these: What causes one woman to make most of her clothes at home, and another woman to use her sewing machine only for minor repairs? How can we convince more people that it’s safe to buy through mail- order? Why will men instantly buy an automatic potato peeler—and women send it right back to the store again? ese are research questions. ey deal with psychological dimensions. e copy writer discovers them, and passes them along to his MR people to be phrased, tested and answered. us is born a new idea, a new theme, and a new headline, perhaps even a new campaign. On Expressing the Personality of a Product in Your Headline One of the most potent discoveries of motivation research is that a product, or a store, or a whole group of products has a distinct and complete personality to the consumer. is personality is a complex quality, embracing many traits. In the case of the Cadillac, for example, it consists of quality, prestige, performance, appearance, comfort, resale value, freedom from repairs and much more.

eﬀective in summarizing and expressing this personality. In the case of Cadillac, it has always been, and will always be, quality. is summary trait is featured in a series of headlines, or headline illustrations—perhaps blended with one or two of the other traits to give it variety but always strengthening those other traits by interrelating them to this one dominant quality. us the personality is simpli\u0016ed, symbolized and sharpened to grasp the reader. And then—as the reader moves on through the body copy of the ad—this personality is expanded and examined in all its appeals—an ever-enlarging pyramid of persuasion, drawing in all the necessary information—charging that information with desire—terminating inevitably in the one source of satisfaction for that desire—your product. We will examine this concept more thoroughly in Chapter 8—on Identi\u0016cation. On the Only Type of Prevention Headline at Will Sell Many copy writers believe that no prevention headline can ever be eﬀective, because it treats a problem that may occur and that is not actually plaguing your prospect at this moment. e reason they give for this failure is the inability of the prospect to identify himself with a problem that has not already forced itself upon him. is is true—but only for those problems which aﬀect him personally. He is perfectly capable of imagining such problems aﬄicting his loved ones, his friends, his wife and children, even his nation. is is why decay-preventing toothpaste sold so well when the ads focused the decay, not on the parent, but on the children. is is why life insurance can be sold, not by picturing the prospects death, but the horrors in\u0019icted upon his wife and children if insuﬃcient money is le over to take care of them. To sum up: A man will not visualize future disasters occurring to himself, but he is perfectly capable of visualizing, and buying preventatives from, the image of such future problems aﬀecting others around him. On the Selection of Splinter Markets to Avoid Competition roughout this book, we have assumed that each competitor in a market will try to advertise to that market as a whole. For example, that every reducing aid will try to sell all women that are interested in losing weight. is assumption is not necessarily true, in at least two respects. First, it assumes that such a market is all of one piece (for example: that all women want to lose weight for the same reason). ey do not, of course. ere are at least two major sub-categories in the market—those who want to lose weight for appearance reasons, and those who must lose weight because of their health. e same general appeal—LOSE WEIGHT—will be eﬀective with both. But certainly the mechanisms should vary—speed and ease in the \u0016rst—safety and permanence in the second.

regionally. But it may be even more eﬀective if it is based on the sociology of the market rather than its geography. For example, a reducing aid may decide to abandon the greater appearance segment of the market, and appeal much more speci\u0016cally to the health segment. is deliberate focusing of the appeal would alter every aspect of the campaign, from the headline, through identi\u0016cation copy, through mechanism and substantiation—right down to the selection of media and channels of distribution. (Health and geriatric magazines, and distribution through doctors rather than drug stores.) Eventually, of course, if the appeal is successful and the budget grows, then the advertiser can decide to invade the majority market. If he does this, the success of the initial limited campaign can be used as a point of diﬀerence to appeal to the larger market. For example, the fact that women who were forced to lose weight permanently relied on this product more than twice as oen as any other, etc. In Summary e \u0016rst \u0016ve chapters of this book, which you have just \u0016nished, describe a process which may take days, or weeks, or months to complete. is process begins with a thorough analysis of the market for your client’s product—with an attempt to measure the breadth and depth of that market—to identify the gigantic emotional forces that create that market—to de\u0016ne and focus those forces in terms of a single image or desire or need—and to channel those forces toward one inevitable solution—your client’s product. In order to do this, the second step of this process involves a meticulous study of the product itself—what it is and what it does—the physical product that you will deliver, and the functional product that you will sell—all its various satisfactions and performances—again focused to a single image, a single identi\u0016cation, a single claim that will tap the greatest possible emotional force within your market. e combination of these \u0016rst and second steps gives you the theme of your ad—the desire your market demands and its satisfaction … the need your market feels and its solution … the identi\u0016cation your market gropes for and its expression. And once you discover this theme, you begin the process of expressing it. You explore the state of maturity of your market. You \u0016nd out how much people know about your product and what it does—how much they’ve been told about similar products—and how much they care about both. Out of this analysis comes the point of entry for your headline—the point of contact—the point of greatest interest and acceptance on the part of your prospect. It may be located anywhere—in your product itself, in its price, in its performance, in the satisfaction your product promises, in the need your market demands from your product, or only in the market itself.

Again, this process may take weeks or even months. And at the end of that time, you may have written \u0016ve or ten words. ese \u0016ve or ten words will make up about 90% of the value of your ad. If you are right, they may start a new industry. If you are wrong, nothing you write aer them will save your ad. Copy writing—on the idea level—is an all or nothing profession. You build your idea, piece by piece … you crowd it into \u0016ve or ten words … and then it stands or dies by itself. And everything that follows it, stands or dies with it. is is why we have devoted so much time to this planning process. And it is a process. You don’t get an idea or a headline—you either build it, or you unfold it, petal by petal. You dig it out of the market research … you wring it out of the product … you read, you listen, you experiment for yourself. You work—hard. You rub up against this product and this market so hard that they seep into your pores. And— above everything else—you remember this cardinal ride of creativity: What you are looking for in this product and this market is the one element that makes them unique. e idea you want—the headline you want—the breakthrough you want—are all wrapped up inside that product and that market. Nowhere else. And no outside ride—no outside formula will give them to you. You are facing a product-market-timing relationship that never happened before—it is unique. And the solution you need is just as unique. What this \u0016rst part of the book has tried to give you is not molds, but compasses. Not formulas to copy word by word, or rules to rigidly follow. But rather guide-posts to set your thinking in the right direction. Speci\u0016cally and technically, these guideposts fall into two classes: e \u0016rst are analytical procedures. eir purpose is to break down a complicated problem into its parts … to examine those parts one by one … to \u0016nd out which is the most important—and to start your solution from there. Once you have done this, you then begin to build up your solution to its greatest power. You do this by removing limiting factors, and by adding everything you can \u0016nd that will strengthen your idea. If we wrote literature instead of advertising, these two processes would be called conception and execution. In copy writing, we say that we get the main theme for our ad, and then we put it into a headline. And when you have \u0016nished, you have \u0016ve or ten words. If they are the right words, they will be immensely valuable.

In the remainder of the book, we shall discuss the techniques of writing the body copy of your ad. ese techniques are directed toward one end: building conviction—not only instilling the desire for your product, but actually strengthening that desire with the belief that that product will DO what the prospect wants. We now turn to this process of building your ad, so that your ad builds conviction. PART II - THE SEVEN BASIC TECHNIQUES OF BREAKTHROUGH ADVERTISING HOW TO WRITE BODY COPY AS STRONG AS YOUR HEADLINE 1 - INSIDE YOUR PROSPECT’S MIND—WHAT MAKES PEOPLE READ, WANT, BELIEVE You have now built your headline. You now have a means of stopping your prospect—of bringing to a momentary halt all the diverse activities of his mind—of focusing his attention, at least for a moment, on a single thought. is is the job that you have designed your headline to do—not to sell, or identify your product, or even mention the need or desire that your product satis\u0016es—but simply and solely to \u0019ag down your prospect, and get him to read your \u0016rst paragraph. From that moment on, your body copy does the selling. It does this by altering your prospect’s vision of reality. It creates a new world for your prospect—a world in which your product emerges as the ful\u0016llment of the dominant desire that caused this man to respond to your headline. To create this world, your copy must expand or alter one or more of the three dimensions of his already-existing mental world. is is the task of the remainder of your ad. Your copy must be long enough to accomplish this change—and the length of your ad will depend on three factors: First, how much copy you need to build his desire for that product— and everything that product can do for him—to its greatest possible strength. Second, how much additional copy you need to make him feel both comfortable and complimented by that product, to enable him to visualize that product as a part of the life structure that he has built, and is building, for himself. And, \u0016nally, how much additional copy you need to make him believe what you have said—to compensate for his already-existing prejudices and beliefs. e answers to these three questions determine not only the length of your ad, but also its structure, its development, its style and its pace. Each of these questions relates to a separate dimension of your prospect’s mind —diﬀerent ways he has of arranging thoughts and feelings. In this chapter, we will examine these three dimensions brie\u0019y, and sketch in what ways, and to what extent, you can alter or expand them through your ad. And then, in the following chapters, we will detail these mechanisms of persuasion thoroughly along with the most eﬀective techniques of presenting them.

purchase. Let us start with these three dimensions of thought and feeling: 1. Desires ese are the wants, needs, cravings, thirsts, hungers, lusts, etc. that drive your prospect through life. ey are physical—such as the desire to be thin, or strong, or healthy, or free from acne, corns, bad breath or what have you. ey are material—such as the desire to possess money, or a big car, or a beautiful dress. ey are sensual—such as the thirst for a cold glass of beer, or the need for a tired body to stretch out on a so bed. ey have, of course, tremendous driving power. And they already exist. You cannot create them, diminish them, or battle them. But you can expand them, sharpen them, channel them, and give them a goal. And this is your primary task as a copy writer. Your \u0016rst task—and in some ads your only task—is to make your prospect want. To sharpen his desire. To picture every moment of its ful\u0016llment. To let him see it, feel it, touch it, sit in it, listen to his friends rave about it. To make him visualize the wonderful new world your product oﬀers him so strongly that he practically lives in it—and then to oﬀer him that product. e method of doing this—Intensi\u0016cation—will be discussed in the next chapter. 2. Identi\u0016cations ese are the roles your prospect wants to play in life, and the personality traits he wants your product to help him build, or project. ese longings for identi\u0016cation—longings for a sharply-de\u0016ned personality—longings for social status—are, of course, not material or physical or sensual at all. ey complement and intensify the physical desires—add another dimension to them—by making each purchase serve a double duty. us, not only does a woman buy a low-calorie food to become thin, but in so doing she also builds again a radiant, attractive, youthful personality. And not only does a man buy a car for the power, speed and transportation it will give him, but equally as much for the projection of prestige, success and ready-cash-to-burn that this purchase communicates to his neighbors. Call them what you will—goals, hopes, dreams, ambitions, envies, admirations, fantasies or objectives—these subtle, symbolic, never- openly-spoken projections of our own self-images are immensely powerful sales forces. Your task is to put them directly behind your product. To make him feel the prestigious and select group he joins when he becomes a user of that product. To picture for him the people who live in your product’s world today. 3. Beliefs ese are the opinions, attitudes, prejudices, fragments of knowledge and conceptions of reality that your prospect lives by. is is the world of emotionalized reason that he inhabits—the way

mere wishful thinking. But it is not advertising’s mission to argue with them. And no one advertiser can change them. Advertising is not education; it does not have society as its sponsor, nor does it have the years of time that are given to education to produce results. Advertising, like science, must accept reality as it exists, not as it might wish it to exist. Only then can it alter reality—not by smashing into it head-on—but by exploiting its tendencies and giving direction to its energies. Believing is a process—a process of \u0016tting new facts into certain established patterns of thought and conviction. People believe in certain ways. ese beliefs form a \u0016lter through which your product-information must pass or be rejected. And their already-established patterns of reasoning create habit-channels along which your copy must build its conviction—or die. You start with these beliefs as a base. You build up from them by using his kind of logic, not your own, to prove that your product satis\u0016es his desires—to prove that your product works—to prove that his kind of people rely on your product—to prove that no other product satis\u0016es his needs as well. e mechanisms for doing this are shown in Chapters 9 and 10. ere you have them. Desires… Identi\u0016cations… Beliefs. Each of them composed of equal parts of emotion and thought. e three dimensions of your prospect’s mind—the raw materials with which you will work. To study them, we shall deal with each of them separately. But, in actually writing your ad, of course, you will weave them into each other— to create a simple, \u0019uid path of thought from the beginning to the end of your ad. is technique—Blending and Reinforcement—will be the subject of Chapter 14. 2 - THE FIRST TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: INTENSIFICATION irteen Ways to Strengthen Desire e force that creates sales, that powers our present economy, is desire. Mass Desire, spread among millions of men and women. And the art of salesmanship, fundamentally and primarily, is expanding this desire. Expanding it horizontally, among more and more people. Expanding it vertically by sharpening and magnifying it—by building it to such a pitch that it overcomes the obstacles of skepticism, lethargy and price, and results in the sale. Advertising is salesmanship in print. erefore, above everything else, advertising is the literature of desire. It is society’s encyclopedia of dreams … our twentieth-century Wish Book. Advertising gives form and content to desire. It provides it with a goal. ese desires, as they exist in the mind of your prospect today, are indistinct. ey are blurs—hazy, ambiguous, not yet crystallized into words or images. In most cases, they are simply vague emotions, without compulsion or direction. And as such, they have only a fraction of their true potential power.

achieve them. A copy writer’s \u0016rst quali\u0016cations are imagination and enthusiasm. You are literally the script writer for your prospect’s dreams. You are the chronicler of his future. Your job is to show him in minute detail all the tomorrows that your product makes possible for him. is is the core of advertising—its fundamental function. To take unformulated desire, and translate it into one vivid scene of ful\u0016llment aer another. To add the appeal of concrete satisfaction aer satisfaction to the basic drive of that desire. To make sure that your prospect realizes everything that he is getting—everything that he is now leaving behind him—everything that he may possibly be missing. e sharper you can draw your pictures—and the greater the number of them that you can legitimately present—the more your prospect will demand your product, and the less important will seem your price. How much space can you give to this process of Intensi\u0016cation? is depends on two factors—the amount of space allotted to you for the entire ad, and the number of ways you can present your images without giving the feeling of repetition or boredom. First of all, diﬀerent media demand diﬀerent treatments. For example, catalogs, small-space newspaper and magazine advertising, radio and television strictly limit the number of words given to you to draw your images. To \u0016t your message into their structures, you must use either or both of two techniques. e \u0016rst is compression—the boiling down of projections and images into a few key words. And the second is the campaign—the repetition of these key words over and over again—along with a progression of embellishments and diﬀerentiations—through an entire series of advertisements. We shall see how this is done, in detail, at the end of this chapter. On the other hand, large-space newspaper and magazine advertising and especially direct mail give you adequate room, in most cases, to present a full story in these media, the decision as to length depends far more on the second factor—the number of ways you can present your images without giving the feeling of repetition or boredom. No matter what you do, your prospect will take with him only one basic idea, one dominant image from your ad. But with every additional new and diﬀerent way that you can present that idea, it becomes sharper and more real in your prospect’s mind, and it builds up more and more emotional weight. us the problem becomes one of perspective, of fresh viewpoints, of new and diﬀerent detail. Of walking around your product in your imagination, and presenting it to your prospect in every way in which it enters his life.

If your prospect has read the same phraseology before, he will be bored by it, no matter where he encounters it again. And the second obstacle is the phraseology of your own ad. Once you have presented your basic ful\u0016llment in a certain way; then you must vary your viewpoint in your second description, or not present it again. Otherwise you will lose your reader in the middle of your ad. You cannot repeat, but you can reinforce. And every time the same basic promise is given a fresh setting for your prospect, it reinforces the descriptions that went before it, and makes your prospect that much more determined to participate. e presenting of a series of fresh, new and diﬀerent ful\u0016llments for your prospects dominant desire—our \u0016rst mechanism of persuasion—is called Intensi\u0016cation. It takes many forms, with many more certainly to be invented. We will list some of them here, giving the complete copy examples to show how they have been worked out to deal with speci\u0016c copy problems. Our illustrations in this part of the book will be drawn mostly from mail order. e reason for this is simple. Mail order advertising must accomplish its sale from a single ad, without relying on the cumulative force of the campaign, and without help from product display or salespeople. erefore, mail order tries to present as much of the complete story as possible at one time. ese same techniques apply equally well to all forms of advertising. But there they are usually quite compressed, and their purpose and structure was not quite so apparent. Here are these techniques of Intensi\u0016cation: Your First Presentation of Your Claims 1. First present the product or the satisfaction it gives directly—bluntly —by a thorough, completely detailed description of its appearance or the results it gives. For example, this rose ad: MORE ROSES THAN YOU EVER SAW ON ANY ROSE BUSH… Leading Eastern Agricultural College reports: This fabulous rose variety produced 500 blooms in June … 1523 more blooms in July… 1616 more blooms in August… 437 more blooms in September … 4,076 roses all from one single plant… Can you imagine the fantastic beauty of a rosebush that can easily give you MORE THAN 4,000 ROSES from June to September—and then keeps on blooming heavily right up into frost… Can you imagine the fantastic thrill of walking into your garden and actually picking 3 dozen, even 4 dozen roses a day from a single plant, day after day, week after week—and still leave gigantic clusters of bloom on each single plant. Colorful, fragrant roses almost as large as the most expensive Hybrid Teas, yet blooming by the hundreds at one single time … on one single bush! Cherry-pink 3-inch roses overlaid with tinges of red that deepen in ﬁre and brilliance as the blossoms unfold—to reveal a dazzling gold splash on their petals!

stay in bloom weeks after the ﬁrst snows have fallen! … This is the rose with such fantastic blooming power that it will actually give you huge clusters of 10, 12 even 15 ﬂowers on a single stem … and produce those clusters in solid masses of bloom! Clusters as large as both of your outstretched hands put together … clusters that actually measure up to one full foot across … each stem a complete ﬂoral bouquet in itself… that gives you an average of more than 50 NEW ROSES day after day, week after week, for 8, 9 even 10 weeks in a row during the hot “dog days” of summer… Enough roses to ﬁll every room in your house with color and fragrance all summer long … Enough roses to drench your terrace with beauty, to sweep around your home and ﬂood your beds, your borders, your walks, your driveway with solid, living walls of roses all summer long … with just a few plants! And this is the rose you can have blooming in your garden now and for years to come, that will make your grounds the garden showplace of the neighborhood, if you accept this extraordinary ﬂower oﬀer now! … Or, as another example, this description of the results of a Christmas \u0019ashlight projector that shows colored slides of the Bible: … You take out the amazing invention we send you. You simply switch it on. And suddenly every person in the room draws in his breath in excitement and admiration! For there before you on that living room wall— projected four feet wide by three feet tall—is one of the most beautiful pictures you have ever seen! Before your eyes—so real that you can practically reach out and touch her—is the Virgin Mary holding the Infant Jesus in her arms. The picture actually glows with exquisite color. You can see every magniﬁcent detail … the animals huddled around the manger … the tenderness in the Virgins eyes … the smile on the Infant’s face. It’s almost as though you were actually there! Suddenly all the wonderful tales your children have heard … all the meaning and glory of Christmas … come alive before your children’s eyes! Life-sized … as tall as your children … scene after scene parades before them on their living room wall! They actually see the Angel of God announcing the Birth to the Shepherds! They witness the Star of Bethlehem rising over the world! They stand side by side with the Three Wise men in silent adoration! Before their very eyes, they see Christ grow to maturity.

As you give it more and more line, it will turn wider and wider, ﬂy faster and faster … You can ﬂy it in circles only ﬁve feet wide, or you can take it outdoors and ﬂy it in gigantic arcs one hundred feet wide—the size of an entire city lot … You can make this plane soar upward—stall at fantastic heights—dive toward the ground—and then pick up speed and ﬂash upward again in a breath-taking rescue! … You can spiral this magniﬁcent model down into a perfect landing! You can ﬂy two or more planes in formation! You can have jet races! You can have an entire ﬂeet of breathtaking models ﬂown by every member of your family—and you can have them for only $1 apiece—less than ONE-FIFTH the price you’d pay for a plastic model of this size and performance! … Or, as another example, this product-in-action description from a brochure selling a self-propelled \u0016sh lure: … Think of it! To fuel up this amazing, live-action lure, all you do is this. Simply snap open the fuel chamber— pour in the absolutely harmless fuel—and close the fuel chamber again! … Simply cast or lower that power-packed lure into fresh or salt water—and get set for the ﬁshing thrill of your life! For perhaps one minute, the lure will ﬂoat quietly on the surface of the water. But then that water will reach the fuel charge inside—the lure will seem to shudder for a second—and then it will spring dramatically to “life”! The air around it will be ﬁlled with the buzzing sound of a dying bee! Instantly, the nose of the lure will point downward, and it will begin its ﬁrst descent! Slowly, jerkily, like a maimed minnow, it will swim noisily downward—buzzing and humming—traveling about nine feet every ﬁfteen seconds! If no ﬁsh intercepts it, it will then automatically stop its descent—slowly raise up its nose—and begin its irresistible climb to the surface again! And again! And again! Tirelessly—hour after hour— lengthening out the reach of your own casts! Roaming restlessly over every foot of water beneath you—even on a slack line—even when your boat is tied up—even when you’re curled up on the dock, sound asleep! … And driving the ﬁsh around you into such a frenzy with its swimming and its buzzing that they practically tear the rod out of your hands—they’re so anxious to get their mouths into the hook! … Bring In the Reader 3. Or, if your product lends itself to this kind of treatment, put your reader right smack in the middle of this product-in-action story, and give him a verbal demonstration of what will happen to him the \u0016rst day he owns that product.

You’ve made only one simple change to that car, so easy that your sixteen year old son could do it. But now, when you turn on the ignition, a modern miracle of engineering science comes to life under your hood! From the very ﬁrst moment, you’ll see and feel the diﬀerence in that engine! … When you release the emergency brake, your car will glide out of its parking space—roll down the street with your foot hardly touching the gas pedal. Every 30 or 40 seconds, you’ll give that car an extra shot of gas—feeling it spurt ahead—testing the new power that’s singing underneath your foot! We ask you to pull up to another car at the stop light, of approximately the same year and make as your own! Wait until the light changes from red to green. Let the other car start ﬁrst. Wait till the other car gets half way across the street. And then slam your foot down on the gas pedal! Before that other car has even crossed the street, you will have caught up with him. For one brief second, you and that other car will race fender to fender. And then you will ﬂash away from him … you will leave him a full block behind … you will look in your rear view mirror and see the startled look of amazement on the other drivers face! … Show Him How to Test Your Claims 4. But there is still more room to expand the image along these lines. Turn the demonstration into a test. Let your reader visualize himself proving the performance of your product—gaining its bene\u0016ts immediately —in the most speci\u0016c and dramatic way possible. For example, in this ad, selling a new kind of spark plug: … when you get your set of SA FIRE INJECTORS, here is all you do. If you have an automatic transmission, make a note of how fast your car crawls forward when it is in the drive position, with the motor idling. If you have a sports car, a racing car or boat, make a note of the RPM’s as indicated on the tachometer when the engine is idling. If you have regular transmission, put your car in low gear on a level road and notice its speed with the motor idling. Next … screw your injectors right into the spark plug openings … Now, if you have an automatic transmission—put your car in drive and let your engine idle. If your car stood still with spark plugs, it will now move forward at from 4 to 6 miles an hour; that means that the amount of gas that just kept your engine turning over will now carry you up to 6 miles at no cost to you.

up with military precision! Giant buds begin to swell with vigor and vitality! Even tired old shrubs and trees—that you had almost given up for lost—begin to straighten out—fatten up—send out the young green growth that you had never hoped to see again! And then, the most remarkable part of all! Just as these fantastically beautiful plants have reached their full, glorious height and strength—at that moment these tiny English pellets automatically liberate still a third wonder- working ingredient!… . And when that third precious ingredient reaches those buds—then that very morning you will open the door to your house—AND YOU WILL BE BLINDED BY THE EXPLOSION OF COLOR THAT GREETS YOU IN YOUR GARDEN! … You will see rose bushes weighted down with masses of blossoms, of a richness and perfume and color you have never imagined before! You will see dahlias and asters and gladiolas so massive, so exquisite, so breathtakingly beautiful that you can hardly believe that they are the same plants that you put in the ground! And when your neighbors begin to pour into your yard—when you watch them bend and touch these ﬂowers to see if they are real—THEN YOU WILL KNOW A FEELING OF GARDEN ACCOMPLISHMENT AND PRIDE THAT YOU NEVER DREAMED OF BEFORE!… Bring In an Audience 6. At the end of this passage, other actors besides the reader are brought into the scene. Each one of them—each group of them—provides a fresh new perspective through which your reader can view the product. Seen through their eyes—experienced through their actions and reactions—the product performances become new, vivid and completely diﬀerent again. ese new participants may be celebrities, who relate their experiences through the testimonial. is technique is too familiar to warrant an example here. Or they may be average men and women, whom the reader easily identi\u0016es with, whose experiences are related through narration or the case history. Probably the most famous example of a narration is the “ey Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano” ad quoted in the \u0016rst section of this book. Here, as an example of the case- history approach, we use a passage from a reducing ad: … And then, if you were like the men and women whose fantastic case histories were reported by leading medical journals, perhaps you went to your doctor and asked him for AN EASY WAY OUT—WITHOUT TORTURE —AND WITHOUT SLIDING BACK! … These doctors had the answer in a tiny grey pill—and a common-sense plan … They instructed dozens of patients to test this miracle plan in their own homes, under these doctors’ supervision. These men and women did NOT give up the foods they loved—they simply and naturally cut down on them!

ugly excess fat around their bodies melted away! While they were eating three delicious meals a day, they were shedding as much as ﬁve pounds a week! While they were feasting on mouth- watering steaks, thick juicy slices of roast beef, potatoes, butter and bread—they were losing inch after inch after inch from around their waistlines, their thighs, their hips. Clothes that they had discarded years before began to come out of the closets and attics. Men and women both —they beam to notice a new young look to their chins and faces that they’d thought they’d lost forever. And when the plan was over … these men and women had lost as much as 17 and 25 and even 34 pounds … they had turned back their weight clock 5, 10 and even 15 years … And their trim, slim ﬁgures were just beginning… Show Experts Approving 7. But not only celebrities and ordinary people can be used to reaﬃrm the product bene\u0016ts. Experts in the \u0016eld—professionals—the sophisticated, the discriminating, the blasé can be called on to register their reactions. ere is nothing so astounding as the astonishment of experts. Here the elements of surprise, competition and discovery all combine to sharpen the image even more. is example is taken from the rose ad mentioned above: … Just picture the scene as these college horticulturists began this amazing ﬂowering test of roses. For here gathered in a test ﬁeld were all the high-praised queens of rosedom … ﬂoribundas, hybrid teas, polyanthas, patented roses and rose blends that today sell for as high as $3.75 for a single plant. Row upon row of roses … prize-winners in international competition … the best the world has to oﬀer… AND THEN, NEARLY WILD STARTED TO BLOOM! Just picture the astonishment on these experts’ faces when in the ﬁrst month alone, Nearly Wild produced over 15 times more blossoms than the average of all other roses combined; how in July alone it produces an average of 50 new roses a day, more than 7 times as many blossoms as the second leading rose! How in August it produced 21 times more roses than its nearest competitor; and then Is it any wonder that a famous rose expert upon viewing the results of this test, exclaimed: “Why, it’s like having a complete rose garden of 20 plants—all on a single bush!” Or why another rose expert, shaking his head in disbelief, stated: “If we ever released these ﬂowering ﬁgures to the public, they’d never believe it.

book-club radio commercial that establishes the diﬀerence between random buying and book-club savings indelibly on the listener’s mind: … Yes! While your friends were paying $3.95 for their copies of Frank Yerby’s run-away best seller, The Golden Hawk, Dollar Book Club members were getting the same exact book for only 99c. While your friends were paying $4.95 for John O’Hara’s ﬂaming new thriller, A Rage to Live, Dollar Book Club members were getting the same exact book for only 99c. And while your friends were paying $5.95 for Thomas B. Costain’s towering new triumph, High Flyers, Dollar Book Club members were enjoying exactly the same book —for only 99c! Or, as another example, here is a passage from a direct mail piece selling a Fuel Reclaimer—a device for the engine of your car that feeds escaping crankcase gases back into your carburetor: … This device uses the suction-power of your own motor to scoop up that smoke. And then—in one of the most brilliant ideas in engineering history—it destroys that smoke by feeding it back into your engine, where it is burned up again as a continuous, extra ﬂow of fuel! Think of it! Instead of polluted oil, polluted engine, polluted air—you get a constant stream of extra gasoline ﬂowing into your engine, almost as though you had a free, second gas tank connected to your car! Instead of one breakdown after another, one more repair bill after another, each more expensive than before, you get young-car power, young-car economy, young-car resistance to repair bills, because the deadly sludge- causers, acid-causers, ﬁlth-causers that used to ruin your car, are now being burned up as fuel in your engine!… Picture the Black Side, Too 9. And there’s no need to neglect the Heaven-Or-Hell approach. Here the negative aspect to every promise—the problem that you are liberating your prospect from forever—is painted in all its full black color. You irritate the wound, and then you apply the salve that heals it. us you derive two currents of motivation—repulsion away from the former problem or inadequate product, and the attraction generated by your own product’s contrasting solutions. ere are several forms in which you can present this before-and- aer picture. You can do it through narration or the testimonial. You can do it by using the “pitch” technique of product ridicule. Or you can simply present straight description of the old product or problem, with all its detailed drawbacks, and then follow it directly with a similar description of your new solution in a perfectly parallel style, item by item. Here, as an example, is a passage from an ad selling a new kind of spark plug: … Someday, if you ever have a spare moment, lift one of the old-fashioned spark plugs out of your car!

what you’ll see on the bottom of that plug is FILTH! The Firing Point of that plug—the most important single point in your car—will be choked, strangled and fouled with BLACK, FILTHY CARBON! Carbon that robs your car of as much as 20 vital horsepower every time your engine ﬁres! Now, wipe that ﬁlth away and look at the Firing Point itself. This is the POWER POINT of your car … the pin- head of electricity that turns raw gas into 300 horsepower of driving energy! And what is the condition of that point? CORRODED—PITTED—SCARRED—AND WORN! Hardly able to deliver half the spark that it should! Wasting gas— wasting money every time you put your foot down on the gas pedal! Yes! You pay $2,000—$3,000—$4,000 for your car. And a single 99c part robs you of the real power and enjoyment of that car. AT LAST! A PLUG SO SMART THAT IT THINKS! Now look at the new plug—the revolutionary Power Flash plug that I’ll send you—for exactly the same price that you’re paving today. Here is a plug that has not only ONE ﬁring point—but hundreds of potential ﬁring points! That actually ELIMINATES THAT DEADLY CARBON—burns it up— throws it away—KEEPS ITSELF SPARKLING CLEAN ON EVERY SINGLE STROKE! The full, blazing horsepower that was there when your car was brand-new, is still there as much as 30,000 miles later. But that’s just the beginning! This plug actually gives you the full ﬁring power you need for every driving condition—smooth, dependable power for city stop-and- go driving—eﬀortless horsepower for the parkway— blazing reserve power for super speeds… And that’s still just the beginning! Best of all, this is one of the toughest, strongest, longest-lasting plugs ever made. You could actually pound it against a concrete wall with a hammer without even denting it—and this amazing plug would still ﬁre clean and hot with 30,000 miles! Yes! These fantastic plugs give you such consistent, long- lasting service that we can aﬀord to make one of the most amazing guarantees you have ever heard… Show How Easy It Is to Get ese Bene\u0016ts 10. To repeat again, the variations are limitless. At every point that your product touches the life of your prospect—price, availability, ease of use, durability, portability replacement and maintenance, even unwrapping the carton it comes in—it furnishes you with another fresh perspective in which to reiterate and reemphasize its bene\u0016ts. Here is just one example—stressing the ease of application, and contrasting it with the tremendous bene\u0016ts that that application gives you: … One week from today, you are going down to your car. You are going to lift up its hood—you are going to take the black, shining can we send you—and you are going to simply pour its contents into the oil ﬁller pipe of your car!

diﬀerent ways! With just 30 seconds work, you will strengthen the engine of that car so greatly that you will get 2 to 3 to 5 miles more per gallon from every gallon you buy… With just 30 seconds work, you will lubricate that engine so thoroughly that you will drive up to 5,000 full miles without even looking at your oil… And, with just 30 seconds work, you will protect that engine so completely that you will add up to four years to its power and life! … You will push oﬀ the ring and piston jobs that might cost you $75 each—for years! Use Metaphor, Analogy, Imagination 11. Nor do you have to be satis\u0016ed merely with the statement of raw fact. ere are in\u0016nite opportunities for the use of imagination to present those facts in more dramatic form, outside of the rigidly realistic approach. Some of the more famous examples are the Alexander Hamilton ad of the Twenties, “The Glory of the Upward Path.” Or the Big Ben alarm clock series, “First he whispers, then he shouts.” Or this passage from perhaps the most long-lived ad of them all, the Sherwin Cody English Course, in which a manual of instruction is personi\u0016ed and given actual life: The basic principle of Mr. Cody’s new method is habit- forming. Anyone can learn to write and speak correctly by constantly using the correct forms. But how is one to know in each case which is correct? Mr. Cody solves this problem in a simple, unique, sensible way. 100% Self-Correcting Device. Suppose he himself were standing forever at your elbow. Every time you mispronounced or misspelled a word, every time you violated correct grammatical usage, every time you used the wrong word to express what you meant, suppose you could hear him whisper. “That is wrong, it should be thus and so.” In a short time you would habitually use the correct form and the right words in speaking and writing. If you continued to make the same mistakes over and over again, each time patiently he would tell you what was right. He would, as it were, be an everlasting mentor beside you—a mentor who would not laugh at you, but who would, on the contrary, support and help you. This 100% Self-Correcting Device does exactly this thing. It is Mr. Cody’s silent voice behind you, ready to speak out whenever you commit an error. It ﬁnds your mistakes and concentrates on them. You do not need to study anything you already know. There are no rules to memorize… Before You’re Done, Summarize 12. To repeat again, there is an in\u0016nite number of new approaches. No list of them can ever be complete, because new applications, new perspectives, new viewpoints are being discovered every day.

As long as each additional fresh perspective continues to build the dominant desire in your prospect’s mind, use it. But if the additional perspective is not diﬀerent or dramatic enough to renew your prospect’s interest in your claims, then leave it out. To a large degree, this is a matter of sensitivity and originality on your part. e sensitivity comes from intuition and experience; the originality oen comes from nothing more than hard work. And perhaps the best way to measure the balance between the two —that critical turning point where reinforcement becomes mere repetition—is to re-read your ad, some days aer you have \u0016rst written it. ere are, however, two conventional summary devices which are almost always used, and which must be mentioned here. e \u0016rst of these is the “catalog”. is is a brief condensed listing of all the product’s performances, bene\u0016ts, and/or applications, one aer the other, without description, dramatization or elaboration. Each of the bene\u0016ts or perspectives which might have been given three or four paragraphs at the beginning of your ad, is here summed up in a single line. ere are two types of catalogs. ose that expand desire horizontally, among ever-enlarging groups of applications or prospects. And those that expand desire vertically by deepening or magnifying that desire. Here is an example of the \u0016rst type of catalog—used to list all the applications of a blow torch kit that might conceivably sell it to a home owner: ALL IN ONE! Blow-Torch, Paint-Remover, Soldering Iron! Professional Propane Torch also doubles as fast, safe Paint Remover and precision Soldering Iron! Does 101 jobs around the house, including— Laying tile; removing paint or putty; thawing frozen pipes; sweating copper tubing; soldering gutters; repairing electrical work; starting charcoal ﬁres and ﬁreplaces: burning weeds, parasites and damp leaves; thawing frozen locks; light brazing; loosening rusty bolts; car body and fender repairs; soldering aluminum, silver and jewelry and other hobbies, and many, many more… It is quite obvious, of course, that this catalog device uses the “shotgun approach.” Up to this point, your ad has taken a single dominant desire, and developed that single desire to the point of absolute maximum intensity. is willingness to gamble on being precisely right— on having chosen the one most powerful appeal—gives your ad the impact of a high-velocity ri\u0019e. But it also demands the accuracy of an expert marksman. Now—through this multi-appeal catalog listing—you have a last- minute chance to hedge. Now you “shotgun” with every wide-angled appeal, bene\u0016t and application in the book. Before you were heightening a single desire, by picturing the satisfaction of that desire in a dozen diﬀerent settings. Now you are building an eﬀect of a diﬀerent kind—one of sheer magnitude, of number, of in\u0016nite possibilities—in the hope that any one of them, or the combination of all of them working together,

continuation of the memory book ad we quoted above: … But this is just the beginning of the “miracles” you can perform with your memory. This secret is just one of the over 50 MEMORY INTENSIFIERS contained in this book… For instance—REMEMBERING NAMES AND FACES! … How would you like to walk into a room of twenty new people—meet each one of them only once—and then remember their names, automatically, for as long as you live … Think of the advantage in business, when you can call every customer by his ﬁrst name, and then ask for his wife and children, instantly, by their ﬁrst names! Think of the impression you’ll make when you ask him about the state of his business, his hobbies, when you repeat, almost word for word, the last conversation you had with him. Think of becoming the celebrity at your club—as the member who “knows everyone”—who can be depended on to avoid mistakes, to win new friends for the organization, to get things done! But this is still just the beginning! This book teaches you to remember exactly what you hear and read! … It teaches you how to memorize a speech or a sales presentation in minutes! It teaches you how to remember every card played when you relax at night! … It shows you how to improve the depth and force and power of your mind! How to double your vocabulary—learn dozens of ways to burn new words into your memory—learn their meanings without looking them up—repeat entire phrases, sentences, paragraphs from the great writers! You’ll be able to learn a foreign language in a few short weeks—at least three to four times as quickly and easily as you could without this system! You’ll be able to hear a joke, story or anecdote only once, and then repeat it in the same hilarious way! Yes! And most important of all, this book will show you how to professionally organize your mind—do what you have to do in half the time! You’ll remember dates, addresses, appointments—automatically! You’ll carry dozens of telephone numbers in the ﬁle-cabinet of your mind! … Let me send you this book, and prove these facts to you in one short evening, or it doesn’t cost you a penny! … e second use for this catalog technique is to pile desire upon desire, rather than application upon application. It is again a building of magnitude, of number—but this time in summary of all the perspectives that have gone before. is example is taken from the Fish Lure ad quoted above: … Here’s What This Amazing, Self-Propelled Fish Lure Does For You!

At the end of your ad as well as at its beginning—use Intensi\u0016cation— building desire by presenting continually new images of its satisfaction through your product. It is the \u0016rst of the Processes of Persuasion. How to Apply ese Principles of Intensi\u0016cation to the Campaign As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, we have used predominantly mail-order examples to illustrate the mechanism of Intensi\u0016cation. We have done this for two reasons. First, because mail order customarily uses long copy and hyperbole; and it is through the extremes of this long copy and these superlatives that we can see these techniques working most clearly. Secondly, we have used mail order for these examples because mail order says all it has to say about a product in a single ad. ere are no mail order “campaigns,” in the sense of a series of diﬀerent-though- related advertisements, appearing one aer the other, and based on a common theme. Mail order compresses such a campaign into a single ad. It says all it can, everything it can think of, in this one ad (which is oen laboriously \u0016tted together out of a series of preliminary ads, each of which contributes some element to the \u0016nished form). And then, when it has proven itself successful, it is frozen—even to the point of typography —and run until it has exhausted its potential. us, mail order as a rule contains the greatest number of these Intensi\u0016cation devices in a single ad; and by studying these mail order ads we can see them working against each other, complementing each other, reinforcing each other, strengthening the overall eﬀect as paragraph is piled on paragraph. But in national advertising, the rules change.

And while the mail order advertisement runs once, and then is not repeated for three to six months, national advertising must keep its product image constantly in front of its public, and therefore must run far more frequently. us, national advertising, by its frequent insertions, soon loses its immediate novelty. e creative problem in national advertising thus changes from \u0016nding the theme for a particular advertisement to \u0016nding the theme for a series of advertisements. And the problem of Intensi\u0016cation shis from building desire throughout the advertisement to building desire throughout the series. And an entirely new problem of balance emerges—that of keeping continuity throughout the series, by maintaining the dominant image sharp enough and identi\u0016able enough to utilize the desire generated by past advertisements, and at the same time varying that image suﬃciently to induce the prospect to read it again, and therefore reinforce and sharpen that desire. Assuming that you have found your dominant image, your creative problem now becomes two-fold. First, to compress that image into a single statement or picture, so powerful that it will sell the product the very \u0016rst time it is used, and so true to the heart of your market that it will continue to sell that product, even when it is used over and over again. It is important to realize that—as the campaign develops—this dominant image or idea cannot remain as the headline. To present the same basic headline (or lead picture) time aer time to the same audience would soon make the campaign unreadable is leads us to your second creative problem. To present a series of variations or perspectives of that central image—each emerging from your dominant idea, but each so diﬀerent from the rest that they impel your prospect to read through them, and so fresh that they make that dominant idea seem new again. us you have your Central Campaign Idea, and its continuous restatement in a series of fresh disguises. ere are as many diﬀerent ways to use this basic technique of campaign construction as there are advertising styles. ey range from the most blatant and obvious to the most subtle. To start at the top, in a brief resume of examples, consider the superbly-eﬀective Colgate campaign of the late 1950s. Here the central idea was openly stated, and precisely repeated, during every advertisement: “Gardol—the Invisible Shield that Protects Your Teeth.” e variations consisted of a series of opening analogies. Using television as the most sharply-de\u0016ned example, an invisible shield was shown protecting the announcer against baseballs, footballs, etc.—against which they would simply bounce oﬀ. e wording of the commercials was ritualistic. Once the initial demonstration was over, there was no variation in the sentences that followed: “Just as this invisible shield (the announcer raps the shield with his knuckles) protects me against

startle the viewer (the ball being thrown directly at him from within the television set) and this emotional reaction is carried over to reinforce the rigidly repeated remainder of the commercial. us you have a quick and startling emotional involvement, welded onto a precise selling message. Equally as powerful is the technique of repeating the exact verbal image throughout a series of advertisements, while varying and freshening the emotional appeal through a spectrum of constantly changing main illustrations. us the dominant image is retained intact —continuity is maintained—but there is no feeling of over-familiarity or boredom. is technique might be named “Rule and Example.” Two of its most eﬀective uses recently have been in the hair styling \u0016eld. First with Toni, where the precisely-repeated verbal image was: “WHICH TWIN HAS THE TONI—and which has the $15 permanent?” Above this unvarying headline was a continuously-changing stream of pretty girls—each new picture making the question new again, and requiring an interplay of examination between the picture and the copy to discover the answer. e same technique was used, some years later, by Clairol to sell their hair tint. Here the Rule was expressed in the precisely-repeated headline: “DOES SHE OR DOESN’T SHE?” “Hair-coloring so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure.” Here again, this headline was re-invigorated by a series of main illustrations, of attractive young women, in common but glamorized every-day activities, enjoying their lives. Here again the Examples not only proved the Rule, but renewed it. At the other extreme, however, the dominant image may not even appear in the advertisements themselves, but may merely be the underlying theme for the campaign as a whole. Here the continuity is retained—not by a precisely-repeated slogan or statement—but by a single, rigidly-maintained focal point. is focal point may be a dominant product appeal—such as the Cadillac quality, which is symbolized in every Cadillac advertisement in the identi\u0016cation background photography, in the typography, in the copy style, in the fashions and jewelry that are chosen to appear with the car, and the credit lines that are given to them—even to the highly-stylized pen-and-ink drawings that are used when the campaign shis to newspapers. Or, if it so merits, the focal point may be simply the product itself. In such a campaign, each succeeding advertisement reveals another fact about the product. Each is completely diﬀerent; no single phrase or slogan is repeated twice. Here the variations comprise the entire verbal content of the advertisements. But their subject-matter, and the illustrations, are always the same—the product. Perhaps the best example of this technique is the magni\u0016cent Volkswagen magazine campaign. Here the advertisements are reduced to severe simplicity. ere is no background identi\u0016cation whatsoever.

car’s performance, utility, economy, durability service facilities and what-have-you. Any single advertisement is suﬃcient to interest a prospective buyer. Together, especially when concentrated in the same media and reaching the same audience week aer week, the series builds an overwhelming impression of novelty and value—the theme of an Honest Car. Here, as examples, are only a few of the dozens of diﬀerent headlines: “THINK SMALL.” (e \u0016rst in the series, discussing the merits of compactness as an asset.) “Lemon.” (Showing what appears to be a perfectly good car, and discussing the microscopic, almost unnoticeable \u0019aw in it that disquali\u0016ed it.) “Our new model.” (A car that shows no diﬀerence, but has dozens of essential engineering changes inside the car, where they won’t make present models obsolete.) “Why you should open the window before you close the door of a Volkswagen.” (Discussing the fact that the car is airtight, and the quality that this fact symbolizes.) “Our number one salesman.” (e serviceman, of course, typifying the quality of care the VW owner gets, and combatting the conception that foreign cars give sparse service.) And so on. A series of building-block advertisements, making no attempt to tell the complete story in themselves, relying on their ability to grasp the prospective buyer and carry him through a procession of short, sharply focused sales stories that combine to give an informed desire of tremendous depth. Notice, incidentally, that each of these headlines ful\u0016lls the requirements necessary to place it at the top of an ad. Each of them reaches out and touches the prospect at the point of his dominant desire (to get more value for his car money). Each expresses the common theme of the campaign (this is an honest car). And each moves the prospect into the body copy—it gets him to read the complete, though brief, selling message. (e \u0016rst second, third and \u0016h headline do this through presenting the reader with an apparent contradiction—in the \u0016rst case, with his accepted notion of “thinking big,” and in the remaining advertisements, between the message of the headline and the content of the photograph above it—thus compelling the reader to go through the body copy to resolve the contradiction. e fourth does it in promising the reader information explaining an unusual and provocative request). Notice also that to accomplish this novelty-within-continuity, and to grasp the attention of the prospect over a series of advertisements, and to move him into the body copy where he can be sold more thoroughly, each of these headlines takes the “Creative Gamble.” e product, its trademark, or its performance is not mentioned in the headline. e copy writer is taking the position that he can only

It announces both its wants and its needs. It responds whole-heartedly and immediately to mechanisms that achieve its aims. erefore, the recognition and magni\u0016cation of this desire is the \u0016rst and most obvious task of copy writing. All the principles and techniques described in the last chapter were practiced to perfection by the patent- medicine copy writers of the 1890’s. Before the First World War, Claude Hopkins had lied them out of patent-medicine and established them in every category of general advertising. Until 1954, they literally dominated advertising. But there is another kind of desire that exists in the human mind—far more subtle, partly unconscious, longing not for satisfaction, but for expression. is second kind of desire is so diﬀerent from the \u0016rst, and operates under such diﬀerent rules, that it can justly be described as a second dimension of the human mind. It may be titled the Longing for Identi\u0016cation. Its rise to prominence as a buying motive marks the great revolution in merchandising of our time. Its utilization in copy writing— as an adjunct to desire-building—constitutes our second Mechanism of Persuasion … that of building the proper Identi\u0016cation into your product. A Personal Note Let me just inject a personal note here on the names I have given these Techniques (or processes) I believe you should use to cumulatively strengthen your copy. As I mention in the Introduction, I have never heard, or read, a discussion of many of these techniques before. erefore, they are not part of the common advertising terminology, and in case aer case actually have no names. Because of this fact, I’ve had to invent names for them. Some of these names convey their meaning at \u0016rst glance, such as Intensi\u0016cation. Other names I’ve put together out of two or more ordinary words, such as Gradualization, to try to convey an idea that has purposely been le ambiguous when you \u0016rst encounter it. And in still other cases, such as the Identi\u0016cation technique discussed in this chapter, I’ve used terms you already know and stretched their meaning. Identi\u0016cation here, for example, means more than the customer’s process of identifying with a product personality, or even with a group of prestige users of that product.

always, in all these techniques, on the word active. ese are the activities you must accomplish … the processes you must utilize … the psychological eﬀects you must achieve to give your copy the maximum possible strength. It is this active, deliberate, ongoing process —this building of eﬀects—that I have tried to convey by these terms. e Roles Your Prospect Desires What, exactly, is this process of Identi\u0016cation? Quite simply, it is, \u0016rst of all, the desire of your prospect to act out certain roles in his life. It is the desire of your prospect to de\u0016ne himself to the world around him—to express the qualities within himself that he values, and the positions he has attained. And how do you utilize this longing for identi\u0016cation when you write your copy? In two ways: First, by turning your product into an instrument for achieving these roles. And second, by turning that product into an acknowledgement that these roles have already been achieved. Every product you work on should oﬀer your prospect two separate and distinct reasons for buying it. First, it should oﬀer him the ful\u0016llment of a physical want or need. is is the satisfaction your product gives him. And second, it should oﬀer him a particular method of ful\u0016lling that need, which de\u0016nes him to the outside world as a particular kind of human being. is is the role your product oﬀers to your prospect. It is the non- functional, super-functional value of that product. And it is built into that product—not by engineering—but by merchandising alone. For example, only the poor man today buys food for its physical satisfactions alone. e average American today selects his food. Selects foods that he believes are modern, because he wishes to be up-to-date. Selects foods that are non-fattening, because he wishes to be youthful and slim. Selects foods that come from every country and re\u0019ect every taste on earth, because he wishes to be cosmopolitan, adventurous and sophisticated. is man no longer buys food for food alone. He has gained or he has been given, a whole new vocabulary of wants. He now buys, not only objects, but roles. His life becomes devoted to a quest for acknowledgements—“up-to-date” … “youthful” … “slim” … “cosmopolitan” … “adventurous” … and “sophisticated” in this one instance alone. And because of this multiplication of wants, this man gives you hundreds of new ways to focus his attention, to stimulate his desire, to build up that desire to the point of purchase. Every new role that he covets—every new longing-for-identi\u0016cation that he develops—gives you one more mass desire that you can harness to your product. What are these roles? Where do they come from? How do they operate? How do you put them to work for your product? First of all—the roles themselves. ere are two kinds. ere are roles that de\u0016ne character.

Character Roles Usually expressed by adjectives, or adjectives-turned-nouns. For instance—“progressive” … “chic” … “charming” … “brilliant” … “well- read.” ey are a part of the personality of your prospect. ey belong to him. His task is to pick out the ones he values most, and to develop them. And then to turn the spotlight of other people’s attention onto them, one aer the other. Attainment of these character roles—mastery of them—is not enough. Once they have been mastered, they must then be acknowledged, valued and admired, or they are worthless. Here again, your product can serve your prospect in three distinct ways—beyond its physical satisfactions—in this constant search for self- de\u0016nition. First, it can help him achieve mastery of his chosen character roles—such as a book on philosophy, if he wishes to be thought of as well-read. Second, it can help simplify condense or speed up this mastery—such as a Speed-Reading Course. And third, and most important, it can serve as a symbol of that mastery to invoke the acknowledgement or admiration of his friends— such as a shelf to house both books. You must realize that every one of these values goes far beyond the physical satisfactions of the products themselves. ey are supra- functional, and therefore add an extra incentive for purchase. e book on philosophy might not have been purchased if the prospect wished only to satisfy his academic curiosity, and did not also wish to enlighten his friends in conversation. e Speed-Reading Course might not have been purchased if the prospect wished only to absorb more information in a shorter period of time, and did not also wish to use that information to get ahead in both his business and social life. And certainly the book-shelves would not have been of the same \u0016ne quality, \u0016nish and luxury if the prospect had only wished to use them as a store- house, and not also as a showpiece. At least half of all purchases made today cannot he understood in terms of function alone. It would be absurd for a man to spend $5,000 for a 150- mile-an-hour sports car for functional reasons, when he only uses it to drive to and from work on congested, 35-mile-an-hour parkways. His willingness to spend this money only becomes rational when you take one further fact into consideration—that this 150-mile-an-hour top speed, this handgear-shi, this fantastic cornering ability all give him as their owner the role of “sportsman”—and very probably “successful sportsman” at that. Every product can bene\u0016t from this role-giving power. But there are many products where this ability of character-reinforcement—whether built into that product by design, by society or by advertising—far outweighs in sales value the built-in performance of that product. In such products, it is the role-giving function that sells, and not the performance. One further fact distinguishing these character roles.

measured, and they are ambiguous. ey are subject to error. And, more important, they are subject to fantasy. Great areas of these character roles literally exist in the subconscious. ey are never given de\u0016nite words. ey are not stated or discussed, but subtly expressed in symbols and images. Only rarely does the prospect even de\u0016ne them to himself. And even more rarely does he test them against the outside world, to see if they are actually true. erefore, your prospect is far more ready to believe in the character roles you assign to him, than he is to believe in either your product’s performance claims, or the achievement roles it may oﬀer him. If the character role is \u0019attering, such as “virility,” and if it is subtly expressed in a non-verbal image-symbol, such as a test pilot smoking a cigarette, than the prospect can easily persuade himself that the same action, smoking, performed on the same product, the cigarette, conveys to him at least some of the implied virility of the genuine possessor—in this case, the pilot. ere is no direct claim made in the advertisement. No verbalization to be passed on by the conscious, rational mind. No test situation called for where the prospect must prove that the role is valid. Acceptance is easy painless, non-demanding. is is not true of a performance claim, which must be justi\u0016ed in terms of concrete results to our friends. Nor is it true of an achievement role, which must stand up to the harsh reality of our position in everyday life. is superb ease-of-acceptance, this consolation-without-cost feature of the character role is its great strength, and the reason why it should be used to supplement the verbal claims in every ad. 2. Achievement Roles ese are the status roles … class roles … position roles that are created by every society on earth, and oﬀered to the men and women who can earn them. In a civilization as complex as ours, there are literally hundreds of them—usually expressed by nouns, with the nouns serving as titles. For example, for men, there are—“Executive” … “Home Owner” … “$20,000-a-year-Man” … “Five Handicap” … “Man-On-His-Way-Up” … “Block Chairman” … and dozens more, embracing every activity of our lives. For women, the primary achievement role to be won is “Wife,” and from then on—“Fashion Setter” … “Career Woman” … “Good Mother” … “Civic Leader” … “Power-Behind-the-rone” … “Patron of the Arts” … and on, and on. e list, for both men and women, is endless. Each of these roles is an achievement to be won, and held, and—most of all—displayed. Here display is vital—because none of these achievements is obvious. Quite the opposite, they are immaterial and invisible—mere titles, roles, bundles of privilege. ey do exist—they are real—and once they are gained, they have great potential to alter our lives.

And the easiest and most universally acknowledged symbols of success in America today are the products we can buy. Products that are purchased—not by any stretch of the imagination for their physical function alone—but for the de\u0016nition they give us as their possessors. In America today we are known—not only by the company we keep—but by the products we own. e most obvious example is the newly-wed woman. Her \u0016rst act in her new role as “Wife” is to receive a physical gi, which has absolutely no function other than to de\u0016ne her—the wedding ring in which she is married. Weeks before this, she has literally been shedding closets-full of clothes—clothes that still \u0016tted her physically, but not socially—in order to replace them with a new material personality, her trousseau. Her sheets and linens are new. Her furniture and carpeting are new. Even the very roof over her head, today, in our society must be new. Because she is literally a new woman—her new role has transformed her —and she must express that transformation in everything she owns. e same principle applies to every aspect of all of our lives. Every social role that we achieve in life is immediately translated into those possessions which we believe express that position most clearly. And as we acquire these possessions throughout our life, what we are doing is constructing for ourselves a “material personality,” that we carry with us wherever we go, and whose function it is to de\u0016ne us, instantly, to whomever we meet. e “Man-On-His-Way-Up,” for example, trades in his Ford for a Buick, and, when he becomes an “Executive,” trades in his Buick for a Cadillac. e “Career Woman” needs an entirely diﬀerent wardrobe than the one she owned as a “Housewife.” And when the man of the house gets a raise, the house either grows bigger, or prettier, or more \u0016lled with status-de\u0016ners of every description—or the house itself is discarded, to be replaced by one more be\u0016tting the new character of its possessor. How to Put ese Longings for Identi\u0016cation to Work for Your Product us products become more than products. In addition to their physical functions, they take on new immaterial functions as status de\u0016ners. ey announce our achievements, de\u0016ne our role in life, document our success. All products may bene\u0016t from this power to de\u0016ne. But in particular, when you have a product that does the same job as its competitors, and is so priced that price is no longer a factor, then the prospect’s choice will almost overwhelmingly depend on the diﬀerence in role that your product oﬀers him.

you use to put it to work for your product follows exactly the same pattern of discovery and magni\u0016cation that you would use for any other desire. First, your job is to discover exactly what kinds of character and achievement roles your prospect is ready to identify with your product— what kind of roles he will reject for that product—and which of the accepted roles is the most compelling. And then you must present those chosen roles in such a way—so vividly and so intensely—that the role you are projecting will become virtually irresistible. Once again, it is your market itself that presents you with both your opportunities and your limitations. And it is your own personal skill as a copy writer that determines how eﬀectively you side-step those limitations, and how fully you realize the potential of your opportunities. First of all—the limitations. Above everything else, of course, you cannot force your market to accept an unrealistic identi\u0016cation. People assign certain characteristics to certain products. ese characteristics may arise out of the product itself—its structure or performance, its history, its cost to produce or sell. Or they may stem from the role or roles that it plays in their lives today—or that similar products play in their lives—or that these products play in the lives of other people, whom they have seen, heard or read about. ese characteristics may be true or false, super\u0016cial or profound, \u0019attering or libelous. But as far as your product is concerned, they are as hard as rock—and just as determinative. ey exist. ey are facts. ey cannot be changed. If you try to break through them and establish a contradictory image, you will learn that they form the walls of a prison. But if you decide to build on to them—to use them as a foundation for sharper, coordinated images, which may be even broader and more appealing—then, if necessary, you can turn those apparent limitations into the strongest selling points in your ad. Not every product needs this technique, of course. Speaking in terms of identi\u0016cation potential, there are two kinds of products. One is the product with built-in prestige—the sports car, the swimming pool, the diamond bracelet. ese rare and expensive products already embody the identi\u0016cation appeals most Americans want. ey actually symbolize these appeals success, achievement, adventure, self-indulgence, exclusivity—so unquestionably that they can be used to weld these same values onto other products. But these other products—by far the overwhelming majority of the products you will be given to work with—have no such built-in prestige. It is up to you to create their prestige for them. And you must do this by building on the characteristics they already possess—by using these accepted characteristics as a bridge—between the product… the image it already has … and the prestige-\u0016lled image that you want to wind up with.

immensely powerful form of desire—a desire, not for physical satisfaction, but for expression and recognition. ese longings for identi\u0016cation are two-fold. We all wish to express our character, and we all wish to gain recognition for our accomplishments. But we cannot do this openly—verbally. We cannot go around boasting how virile we are, or how rich we are. So we symbolize these prestige claims. We express them in terms of products—and we buy products that express them. As Americans, living in our culture and our century, there are certain character roles and certain achievement roles that we value more than others. e most general and compelling of these are: the wish to be virile or feminine—the wish to be exciting, unique, fun-\u0016lled and adventurous —the wish to be friendly and well-liked—the wish to be important, in\u0019uential and correct—the wish to be modern and up-to-date—and above all, the wish to be successful, to make something of our lives. ese are the roles most Americans buy. In some splinter markets, other, contradictory roles may apply. But, in the mass, these are the characteristics that will turn the prospects from one brand to another. e Primary Image of Your Product ere is a critical point that separates the process of building identi\u0016cation from the process of building desire, namely, that the product you are given has its own personality at the moment you are given it. It has its own characteristics. And these characteristics may contradict what most Americans want—or simply not include them—or simply not include as many of them as you want. For example, a cigarette is not, by itself, a symbol of success. But you realize that if you could make it a symbol of success, you could sell many more of them. Nor is a piston ring, by itself, a symbol of virility—even though that virility image, if you could create it, would sell many more piston rings. And, though household appliances are not, at \u0016rst glance, symbols of femininity, women would buy many more of them if they could somehow be made feminine. How do you do this? In two steps—the \u0016rst of which is to identify the primary image that each of these products already has in the mind of your prospects. For instance, a cigarette is virile in almost everyone’s mind. And a piston ring is precision-machined and full of mechanical beauty to almost every man. And household appliances are time-saving, by virtue of the very functions they perform. ese are the primary images of the products you are called on to sell. ese are the accepted images that they already have in your prospect’s mind. Your job now is to use these already-accepted images as raw material, as a starting point to construct new, double, triple, and quadruple images, which draw in more of these most-wanted roles into your product- personality, and multiply its identi\u0016cation appeal.

By emphasizing and dramatizing that primary image, if it is already acceptable. Or by toning it down, if it is negative or neutral. For example, the male virility naturally associated with cigarettes is a de\u0016nite sales aid, even with women. e sheer physical act of smoking— of “playing with \u0016re”—of “breathing \u0016re”—has been for centuries an assertion of manhood and of daring. But Marlboro took this image of virility and intensi\u0016ed it—deepened it—in three ways. First, they presented men who were, in themselves, virile. Second, they presented these men in situations or occupations that demand virility. And third, they took the further “Creative Gamble” of aﬃxing to these men’s hands one of the most primitive symbols of virility known to history—the tattoo. A single dominant emotion—virility— symbolized three ways. e impact of repetition reinforced through variation. Far more powerful—far more eye-catching—far more appealing than any one of these images could have been by itself. So far, there has been no diﬀerence between this technique and the intensi\u0016cation of desire we discussed previously. Although we are speaking here in visual terms, the mechanics are exactly the same—the intensi\u0016cation of an already-existing emotion in your prospect, through a series of reinforcing images expressing the ful\u0016llment of that emotion. With certain, naturally-favored products, this process of intensi\u0016cation may be all that is required—though even Marlboro, as mentioned below, goes beyond it. But—and this point is imperative— though the process of intensifying desire for your product ends here, the process of building the proper identi\u0016cation for your product—of building prestige for that product—only begins here. For the primary image of your product may not be favorable. It may be negative—contradicting the roles most people want to play. Or it may simply be neutral—a wall\u0019ower product—oﬀering most people no emotional reaction at all. In both these cases, your \u0016rst suggestion may be to simply discard these primary images altogether, and substitute more favorable ones. is has been done in countless advertisements. And it doesn’t work—for a very simple reason. Because people just won’t believe that a product is what it isn’t. You cannot contradict accepted images or beliefs in advertising. is is not advertising’s role. Nor is it really necessary. In order to overcome these unfavorable images, you simply incorporate them in a larger, overall image—lower their emotional intensity—and use them as readily-accepted bridges to lead your prospect into far more compelling appeals. How to Build New Images Into Your Product is is a single process, but it is made up of two steps. First, as mentioned above, a change in the intensity of your primary image—in this case, subordinating it even though you retain it. And second, using it as a logical link to bring in any number of more favorable images. One of the most striking examples is the Chester\u0016eld ad of 1926 —“Blow Some My Way”—fully examined in Chapter 3.

smoking, and smoking situations, more acceptable to women, it would have been impossible to do this by picturing the woman alone. e idea that women would practice this Masculine act in private, or with each other, was inadmissible. erefore the man must be retained. e accepted image must be acknowledged. But he undergoes two vital transformations. First, he is subdued. His \u0016gure is darkened, almost blended into invisibility with the background. And his position in the picture—his posture—the arrangement of his hands and face as the light plays over them—all direct the attention of the viewer past the man himself and into the focal point of the picture, the woman sitting beside him. us he becomes a mere suggestion of man, leading the viewer into a far more appealing overall image—that of a handsome young couple, alone together on a moonlit beach, heightened emotionally with the carefully-blended-in suggestions of escape, intimacy, and a sense of shared daring. Because the primary image is there—because the smoking is done by the man—the viewer, even a well-brought up woman of the 1920s, accepts the situation. But this acceptance, once established, goes far beyond that primary image. is feminine viewer is also willing to accept the romance of the overall scene—including its emotional undertones of escape from the conventional rules and boundaries, and its feelings of relaxation and liberty. She is now willing to project herself into this scene. And in accepting the scene as a whole, she is \u0016nally led to accepting the climactic words, “Blow some my way,” as being a perfectly natural and acceptable action for her to take, with all its implications for her conduct in the future. is, then, is the process of identi\u0016cation—of building prestige for your product. To weave favorable social and character images into the personality of your product, in order to reinforce and even dominate those primary images that your product already has. ere is only one limit to the number, or the range of favorable images that you can add to that product personality. Simply that you must always include the primary image as their base. ey must emerge from that primary image, and they must be logically consistent with its broadest de\u0016nition. For example, to return to Marlboro, once you have developed the primary image to its peak of intensity then there is absolutely nothing to stop you from weaving other powerful appeals into this base. Connotations of success can be included by the model’s clothes, such as the tuxedo worn in the \u0016rst ads, or by the possessions he holds.

at the same time. For example, the single image of ownership of a \u0016ne painting may express, not only success, but also cultural breeding and intellectual accomplishment. Such multi-image symbols perform two vital tasks for your product. ey broaden the size of its market by graing on new emotional appeals —social and character identi\u0016cations that reach into the fringe areas of that market—that intrigue people who would not be suﬃciently swayed by the pure functional values of your product. And second, by adding in these many-sided emotional images, they deepen and intensify the emotional attraction felt for your product by all the men and women who make up that market. Perhaps this can best be shown by taking a hypothetical example, of a product with strictly neutral primary images, and developing, and weaving together, a network of far stronger emotional images for it. Let’s start with piston rings, and assume that a new type of piston ring has just been developed, that lasts longer and therefore saves oil and gas. Our body copy, of course, develops this saving theme. We have exploited the functional advantages of the product as far as possible. We are now ready to reinforce these bene\u0016ts by expanding the product’s social and character appeals. We start by taking inventory. We have a product—piston rings. It has only a few primary images—mechanical, precision-made, unseen. Nothing exciting here. It also has a primary situation—replacement, and always by a mechanic, and usually only when there’s trouble. ese primary images are either neutral or negative. But they’re all we have to work with. ey, and they alone, must form the foundation, must set the direction, for every other appeal we bring into the overall image we are constructing. So we know that we must deal with the act of replacement, and that the replacement must be done by a mechanic. ese are our limitations— but once we observe them, we turn them into the starting point for the true emotional message ice want to broadcast through our ad. We take each of these primary elements, and glamorize, dramatize and emotionalize them to the brink. e car itself—what kind of car shall it be? Certainly not a beat-up family sedan. Why not a Mercedes SL-300—a $12,000 sports car with its distinctive grill-work sides, and all the emotional extras of power, speed, skill-in-handling, plus sophistication, success and downright excitement. Now the garage—what should it look like? A sports-car shop, of course. Neat, clean, precise. With high-power equipment gleaming chrome and steel—hanging on the walls, ready on the shelves, being installed on other sports models in the background. e mechanic is not young, not old, simply mature. Rugged, knowledgeable, precise. He’s sure of what he’s doing—there isn’t a wasted motion or a wasted tool anywhere about him. e owner of the car is young, wiry, virile, but he too has been around.

visual terms, where they can be symbolized, and therefore implied rather than named, they enter into our minds unnoticed, and we accept them without question. Verbal terms—words and sentences—can be used to imply images of identi\u0016cation; but these are diﬀerent types of images, and must be conveyed in a diﬀerent way. We will touch on this verbal image building again, as related to excitement and mood, in Chapter 14. e owner is not a professional driver, but he races the car for sport (we know this by the roll-over bar over the back of the seats). He loves this car (its perfect shine, its gleaming chrome engine, its complete absence of even a spot of dirt). He too is precise (the chronometer on his wrist). And he carries his success with a complete casualness (the absence of any special driving out\u0016t—just slacks and a sport shirt). And what about the relationship between the two men? Knowledge complementing skill. e expert in one \u0016eld advising the expert in another. Comfort, understanding, teamwork—leading to mutual achievement. And what are they doing? Replacing rings, of course. But not because the old rings have developed trouble (nothing in this car would be le unchecked long enough to have developed a \u0019aw). But because this mechanic is installing these new rings in this car as high-performance equipment, exactly as he would install a supercharger to increase its horsepower. Everything about the picture—its camera angle, its composition, its lighting, the angle of the men’s heads and arms as they examine the rings —develops the emotion of precision and the excitement and drama of discovering new performance through greater and greater precision. It is a picture, a situation and a mood that invites participation. e reader may not notice every emotional detail that you have developed; but he will sense the excitement and pleasure that you have built up. He will wish to share in this world. And he will buy the product that gives him this world—that oﬀers it as a bonus to all its functional and physical satisfactions. On the Limits to the Images Your Prospects Will Identify With I must insert a warning here. Although these identi\u0016cation images are immensely powerful when used correctly, there are also strict rules and limits to their use. And, if they are used incorrectly, they can be disastrous. Many campaigns have collapsed because they have asked their market to identify themselves with an unbelievable image. For example, the deodorant-soap campaign of several years ago that used an elite, society image to sell the mass market. e men and women who composed the market could not make the jump between themselves and the characters pictured in the ad. And they not only refused to believe the suggested identi\u0016cation, but the disbelief spread to the performance claims themselves and killed the sales. e key to avoiding such mistakes, of course, is the structure of the word, unbelievable.

We shall discuss this question thoroughly in the next few chapters. However, in relation to image-building, the answer lies in two points: 1. What do people already believe about the personality of your product? Do they believe, today, that it has the character traits that you say it has? And—if they do—can they identify themselves, their lives, their present position in society, or their next step up in society with these traits? If the answer to both these questions is ‘Yes’, then you can use the image exactly as you’ve conceived it. If, however, either one of the answers is ‘No’, then you must move on to the second step: 2. What other primary image do I have to use as a believability-bridge to connect what my prospect already believes with what I want him to believe when he \u0016nishes my ad? If he doesn’t believe that my product has those desirable character traits, then I have to start with what he already believes. I have to use these images as a base, and build up to my desired overall image, as we discussed before. And, in addition, if my prospect believes that my product does possess these target-traits, but doesn’t believe that they relate to his life, as it exists in either the present or the future, then again I have to use a bridge-image. I have to insert a \u0016rst seen image that he can immediately identify with, and use that acceptable identi\u0016cation as a hook to hang my target-image on to. For example, in the Marlboro ad, men who would never identify themselves immediately with a yachting costume or an opera hat, accepted the image completely aer it was introduced by the acceptable virility concept of the male model smoking the cigarette. If you demand that your prospect jump across a believability-chasm, your ad will fail. If, however, you build a bridge of ideas or images across that chasm—starting on his side—then he will let you lead him almost anywhere. On Saleable Identi\u0016cations Springing From the Physical Product Itself We mentioned in Chapter 2 that for the purposes of preparing an advertisement, every product can be considered to be two products. ere is the functional product—what the product does for the consumer. And there is the physical product—what the consumer actually gets. In tapping mass desire, we put aside the physical product, and concentrated on functional performances. Now, in searching for image-sources to build powerful identi\u0016cations, we re-examine the physical product itself. e physical product can be broken down into three separate areas: 1.

As you receive it, that product’s appearance is probably determined by function. Let’s say that the product is mechanical, like a car. In this case, its appearance will be a combination of what it has to do (roll on a highway, carry six people, shelter them against wind and rain, etc.), and the cheapest practical way of doing it. Out of this combination of performance and economy comes the raw shell of your car—its basic functional appearance. It is at this point that you start to build in the images. You do this in two ways. First, you exploit the dramatic primary images that already exist in the extreme forms of your product. For cars, for instance, you borrow from the glamour cars—the severe streamlining and stabilizing \u0016n of the racing car; the hub caps and wheel wells of the sports car; the exhaust ports and roof line of the custom car. And you blend their feeling of excitement and power and distinction into the family sedan. But this is only the \u0016rst step. Once you have exploited the already- existing primary images in your product—if there are any—you then begin to weave in other images that have absolutely nothing to do with the necessary physical structure of your product. And you alter the appearance of your product to accommodate and express these images. For example, many products are chemical rather than mechanical. ey are liquids, powders, sprays, granulates, etc. erefore their physical appearance, to the manufacturer, is completely arbitrary. Outside of the need to hold them together and shield them against wear, their physical package can take any shape you wish. Here, of course, there are no primary images arising from functional appearance at all. All the images that you wish to shape into your package must be borrowed. And where do you borrow them from? From the background of your product. Or from its components. Or from the values of society as a whole. For example, the product’s background: One of the most brilliant packaging concepts in years was Johnson & Johnson’s Micrin. Here was a mouth wash—a liquid—sold in drug stores and supermarkets—whose eﬀectiveness far exceeded any similar product ever sold before. How were they to convey that eﬀectiveness to the consumer at a glance? ey simply took the physical shape of glass containers that are found only in doctors’ oﬃces and operating rooms, and transcribed that exact shape onto an over-the-counter product. Use this shape to house an ice- blue liquid, that in itself suggests medical cleanliness, and you have a product that says instantly, “is is doctor’s-liquid. is is medicine. is works.” Here the background of the product is symbolized in the product’s container.

It is the copy writer’s job to make sure the path to these goals goes through the product—and to make sure that the prospect can visualize every drop of satisfaction that their achievement will give him. e second dimension is Identi\u0016cation—the need for expression and recognition—unformulated, unspoken, at least partially unconscious— searching for symbols, de\u0016nitions and embodiments. It is the copy writer’s job to crystallize these self-de\u0016nitions and embody them in his product—so that the product may be used, not only as a source of physical satisfaction, but also as a symbolic extension of the personality of the prospect for whom it is intended. Until now, this book has been concerned with these \u0016rst two dimensions. ey have determined the selection of our headline and our illustration, and most of the content of our ad. But—important as they are—desire and identi\u0016cation alone are never enough. By themselves, they can never produce the full reaction the copy writer must have if he is to achieve the maximum success with his product. No matter how intense the desire, no matter how demanding the need to identify, both these reactions must be fused with a third great emotional force—Belief—before they can produce the \u0016nal overwhelming determinant of action—Absolute Conviction. It is this fusion of desire and belief—this conviction—this certainty— this feeling in the prospect of being right in his choice—of being assured of what he has been promised—that the copy writer seeks as his ultimate goal. And it is to this third dimension of the human mind—the Belief that produces this certainty—that we now turn. What Exactly Is Belief? It is perhaps the most complex fusion of thought and emotion in the human mind. It is, \u0016rst of all, your prospect’s mental picture of the world he lives in—what facts make it up, how it works, in what direction its truths and values lie.

Even more important is the vast amount of emotional security he derives from these beliefs. It is the wonderful feeling of comfort and reassurance of living in a world that has meaning, where there are answers to be had, where somehow the facts all \u0016t. A world that he can understand and depend on, that he can predict, that will stay together and not blow up in his face tomorrow morning or the morning aer that. Do not be misled for even a moment. e need to believe—and the need for secure beliefs—is just as powerful an emotional force as the strongest desire for physical satisfaction, or the most urgent search for expression. Most adults have done their basic learning of these beliefs when they were children. At that time, and in that dependent stage of their lives, they laid down the primary channels of belief that their minds would follow for the rest of their days. ey were forced to do this, in order to understand the world, to gain its approval, to trust and master it, and to develop themselves into self-sustaining adults. To ask them to shatter even one of these already-established lines of belief—to plunge into uncertainty again—to be forced to reassemble their beliefs in new, untested ways—is to ask them to become children again. And—unless they are “frightened beyond belief,” unless their entire conceptual world has crumbled around them—they simply will not do it. e basic rule of belief, then, can simply be stated as this: If you violate your prospect’s established beliefs in the slightest degree —either in content or direction—then nothing you promise him, no matter how appealing, can save your ad. But, on the other hand, and even more important: If you can channel the tremendous force of his belief—either in content or direction— behind only one claim, no matter how small, then that one fully-believed claim will sell more goods than all the half-questioned promises your competitors can write for all the rest of their days. is channeling of belief is so powerful that, if properly directed, it will even support otherwise-absurd claims. It is simply a question of whether you are going to paddle upstream or down. Whether you are going to work against the tide of established belief, or with it. As far as advertising is concerned, then, belief is immutable. It cannot be changed. It must be complied with at every step. Every one of the statements you make in your ad must \u0016t in with your prospects version of “the facts” at that precise moment. It is not the function of your ad to change those facts. But it is its function—and one of its great sources of strength—to extend them.

gradual succession of more and more remote facts—each of which he has been prepared in turn to accept—is called Gradualization. It is the third Process of Persuasion. Mind you, this process of Gradualization has nothing to do with the oﬀering of proof, or reason-why explanations, or testimonials or documentation. Each of these mechanisms of belief adds to the power of your ad, and we will explore each of them in turn in the chapters that follow. In Chapter 11, we will discuss the verbal demonstration that your product does what you claim—Mechanization. In Chapter 12, we will discuss the destruction of alternate ways of satisfying that same desire—Concentration. In Chapter 14, we will discuss the oﬀering of authorities and proof, the reassurance that your prospect has made a wise choice—Veri\u0016cation. All these devices build belief. But by far the most fundamental of all —though the most inconspicuous—is Gradualization. For Gradualization determines—not the content of your ad—but its structure, its architecture, the way you build it. We have already seen that it is the dominating desire of your prospect that determines the content of your ad. It is his longings for identi\u0016cation and self-expression that, in most cases, determine your illustrations. But it is the facts that he believes in and accepts, and the way that he passes that acceptance along from one fact to another, that determines that ad’s development—the arrangement of your claims and your images and your proofs, so that there is a step-by-step strengthening—not only of your prospect’s desire—but of his conviction that the satisfaction of that desire will come true through your product. e Architecture of Belief In essence, then, the theory of Gradualization is based upon this fact: at every claim, every image, every proof in your ad has two separate sources of strength— 1. e content of that statement itself; and 2. e preparation you have made for that statement—either by recognizing that preparation as already existing in your prospect’s mind, or by deliberately laying the groundwork for that statement in the preceding portion of the ad itself. And, because of this fact, we can strengthen the power of each of these statements in two separate ways— 1. By increasing the intensity of its content—by making greater promises, by portraying more dramatic images, by oﬀering more compelling proof; and/or 2. By changing the place or position or sequence in which that statement occurs in the ad—by strengthening the ground-work for belief in that statement by the material which precedes it—and therefore increasing the intensity of belief given to it—the immediate acceptance of its content, without question, when the prospect encounters it in your ad. Make no mistake, it is this acceptance that we are looking for. Eﬀective advertising, like eﬀective literature, is built—not of words—but of reactions. We put down on paper an architecture of words.

and content and direction, and, if we are successful, with a de\u0016nite goal—the absolute conviction in your prospects mind that he must have your product. is is the essence of building your ad. We now turn to the techniques of its accomplishment. A New De\u0016nition of Awareness We now know that Gradualization is the art of starting your ad with a statement that will be immediately and entirely accepted, and then building a chain of subsequent acceptances upon this \u0016rst statement. e purpose of this chain of acceptances is to lead your reader to a goal conclusion, which he will then accept, but which he would not as readily or as thoroughly have accepted without the preliminary statements. is quest for acceptance begins, of course, with your headline. is all-important \u0016rst statement that you make—this meeting place between your story and your prospect—must not only be capable of awakening interest and desire, but of being accepted at the very \u0016rst glance as being true. Interest and believability—these are the two requirements that determine your headline. We have already discussed these requirements in Chapter 2, on the State of Awareness of our market. We can now rede\u0016ne this State of Awareness as readiness to accept. And we can now say—especially in the Fih Stage of Awareness—that the eﬀectiveness of your headline is as much determined by the willingness of your audience to believe what it says, as it is by the promises it makes. is is the reason that you cannot always use the most powerful claim in your headline. Or even the very problem that your product solves. Because without supporting evidence already existing in the mind of your prospect to prepare him for that headline claim, he just won’t believe it. Either he’ll believe that it’s exaggerated or false, or he just won’t believe it applies to him. In either case, too many of your prospects turn away without reading on, and your ad fails. is fact—that your most powerful claim does not always make your most powerful headline—is a paradox that many copy writers still cannot accept. Mail order advertisers, however, have a simple way of proving it. When a power-claim headline doesn’t work—for reasons either of Awareness or Sophistication—they immediately split it against a second head, with far fewer claims in it, but far more likely to be believed. en they build a belief-bridge from this second headline, to the same exact claims they had featured in the \u0016rst, but now anticipated by careful preparation every step along the way. A Detailed Example Let us take such an ad—that we have already glanced at in Chapter 2 —and break down its structure step by step.

Its purpose was to sell a Television Repair Manual. eoretically, every TV owner who was having any trouble with his set (and almost all of them were at that time) was a prospect. But, before the prospect could be turned into a customer, he had to believe two things: 1. at he could save money by making his own TV repairs; and 2. at he was capable of making them. Both these statements were matters of fact. e average TV owner certainly could save money if he had made his own repairs; and about 80% of those repairs were simple enough for him to make himself. But the overwhelming majority of prospects simply didn’t realize these facts. Most of them thought of themselves as non-handymen, even in relation to far simpler devices than a television set. And, in 1951, the TV set was considered a complicated mechanical monster, far beyond their poor powers to understand let alone correct. ese two factors blocked the use of the obvious power-claim headline for this product. Such a headline was written and tested—“Save up to $100 a Year on Your TV Repairs!”—but it failed to make a pro\u0016t. e obvious was unsuccessful. Power alone could not move the product. Two tasks faced the copy writer in revising this ad. First, he had to reach all his prospects in this market, and not just those among them who considered themselves handymen. And second, he had to convince all these non-handymen prospects that their sets weren’t really such fragile, complicated monsters aer all, and that they themselves could easily correct most troubles that arose. Once these two statements were believed by the prospect and only then—could the previous headline claim of “Save up to $100 a year on your TV repairs” be brought in at full power. Let us see, acceptance by acceptance, how this new ad built to that point: e headline, \u0016rst of all, would have to be a general statement, crystallizing and exploiting the universal resentment against the high TV repair bills, the $60-a-year TV service contracts that were then in existence, and the outright thievery that occurred in only a small fraction of the TV repair shops, but that had stigmatized the entire industry. From there—from this universally-accepted resentment—the ad could then build toward the two goal conclusions listed above. Let us see how this was done, statement by statement. Here is the new headline: “WHY HAVEN’T TV OWNERS BEEN TOLD THESE FACTS?” No claim. No promise—except that of disclosure. But here is an implication of foul play, which echoed the existing suspicion in the TV owner himself. Here is a crystallization and outright expression that the average owner felt toward being taken.

overwhelming majority of it: “Was your set purchased after the spring of 1947?” 95% of television owners would answer Yes. us the ad has built two acceptances in its \u0016rst two sentences. It has started a Habit of Agreement in its reader. It now exploits that agreement by making its \u0016rst de\u0016nite promise in the third sentence: “Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60 a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you’ve dreamed about!” How Belief Was Built Into the Opening is is the ad’s \u0016rst claim. Its content alone is extremely powerful. But that powerful content—which otherwise might drive many readers away as being just too fantastic to be believed—has been given extra belief— has been loaned, as it were, extra belief—not only by the \u0016rst two sentences that preceded it—but by these deliberate constructions in the statement itself: 1. By the grammatical construction, “Was your…” in the second sentence, and “en …” in the third which by its very form generates belief. It does this by implying exclusion. It says that the promise will come true only in certain cases; that it will only work for television sets purchased aer 1947; that the ad cannot make this promise for sets purchased earlier. us it adds credence to whatever statement follows it. You can feel this added believability yourself by taking out the lead-word “en” from the sentence and reading it again. Immediately, it loses half its force—force added to the content of the statement by the grammatical-bridge tying it in to the \u0016rst two acceptances. 2. e second attempt at adding believability is by the descriptive nature of the promise. It is not only a promise of reward (the money saved), but a catalog of almost-universal symptoms (repair bills and service fees). Since the overwhelming majority of set owners are suﬀering from these problems, their descriptions evoke two more “Yes—I have them” reactions from the reader, and carry these reactions over to the save-money claims that immediately follow them. If these descriptions were eliminated, the money-saving claims would be much weaker: “Then here is the full, uncensored story of how you can save $15-$20—save $30-$60—save $90-$100 on your TV set—and still get the perfect, movie-clear pictures you’ve dreamed about!” 3. And \u0016nally, even though the causes of the set owner’s problems are speci\u0016cally described, the cures for them are deliberately le ambiguous. e fact that they will save otherwise wasted money, that they will get improved reception, is included—how they will do this is not. e mechanism by which these goals will be accomplished is le out. It is le out because the reader has not yet been prepared for it.

speci\u0016c savings by eliminating them, that are certainly logical to expect. He may or may not accept all these three claims in the sentence completely; but the strength of their promise, the two or three or four acceptances that he has already given, and the implied disclosures still remaining in the body of the ad, should be enough to carry him on, to this next paragraph: “How many times this week have you had to get up to ﬁx a jumpy TV picture? … How many times have you had to put up with ghosts? … How many times…” Here again is reinforcement of belief—the description of universal symptoms—the coaxing out of a stream of agreements. “Yes … Yes … Yes”—he must answer if he has had trouble with his set. A habit of acceptance is being built inside him. Trust is being formed, layer by layer —as each question poses a test, and each yes answer proves to the reader that the ad is talking about him. Already the ad is beginning to weave its pattern of promise and belief and then promise again. Now, with as many as seven or eight agreements behind it to establish a \u0016rm foundation of belief, the ad moves on to its next great promise: “90% Of These Breakdowns Are Unnecessary!” “All of these breakdowns may have seemed tragic to you at the moment they happened—but here is the real tragedy! Do you know that the same exact set that you now have in your front room … has been playing in manufacturer’s test rooms for months—and playing perfectly!” Goal Conclusions e ad is now laying the basis for the \u0016rst of its two goal conclusions —that TV sets are not fragile—that they have amazing endurance if they are properly cared for. Only when the reader accepts this fact, can the ad go on to its second conclusion—that whatever minor breakdowns do occur can be easily handled by the owner himself. But the ad is still \u0016ve paragraphs away from any mention of the owner touching his set. First it must establish the dependability of the set; and it does this by two methods. At the start, in the following two paragraphs, it gives graphic descriptions of the manufacturer’s own tests used to establish this dependability: “These sets have been subjected to ‘Breakdown Tests’ that would seem incredible to the average owner. They have been turned on for 24 hours a day—7 days a week—4 weeks a month. Some of these sets have been naming without a moment’s pause for as much as 17 months. “These sets have been tested against almost every conceivable type of viewing hazard… up to 120 miles away from

as one full year! Here are some of the reasons why:” en, when the reader has fully visualized the impact of these test reports, the ad now turns to expert authority and logical construction to reinforce this belief. Notice in the next few paragraphs how the ad picks up the already-accepted condition. “If your set were properly cared for, as these sets were …”, and uses that now-established condition to prove the series of statements that follow it: WHAT TV EXPERTS HAVE LEARNED ABOUT YOUR SET! “If your set were properly cared for—as these sets were cared for in these tests—it need break down only once during the entire year! In other words, you may actually have to call in a repairman only once during the entire year. You can save the $30-$60 service fees you are now paying—and you can save most of the SERIOUS repair bills.” “If your set was properly cared for, it can actually give you perfect, movie-clear reception the other 364 days a year. It can give you this perfect reception without special electronic equipment—without the help of a repairman— up to 100 miles away from your station.” Notice that in these two paragraphs, the ad returns to the claims made in the third sentence—repeats them almost word for word—and then gives logical proof, in logical form, for each of them. As we have pointed out before, these claims—“you can avoid those $15-$20 repair bills—avoid those $30-$60 a year service fees—and still get the perfect, movie-clear picture you’ve dreamed about!”—were stated in the third sentence without supporting proof at that time; but with strong implication—“Here is the full, uncensored story…”—that such proof would follow. at proof is now submitted, in an extremely formal and logical structure. us the ad again weaves proof into promise—repeating previous claims in a new context of full documentation, where it could only suggest that they would be proven before. Notice also that this logical proof—“If your set were cared for… it need break down only once a year… you need call a repairman only once a year… you save the service fees and most repair bills.”—is, in itself, solidly grounded in the test-proof presented in the paragraphs before it—“being subjected to break-down tests … against almost every type of viewing hazard … and produced perfect pictures, without breakdowns, for as much as one full year.” us a chain of proof upon proof is constructed—each new statement repeating the heart of the proof before it. us the ad has now proved—by using the Mechanism of Intensi\u0016cation—by repeating the same theme-content seven diﬀerent times in seven diﬀerent ways—that your TV set is dependable. e Ultimate Objective is was the \u0016rst goal-conclusion.

do not have to be a handyman or a mechanic in order to coax this performance out of your set! Here’s why:” Notice that it is in this paragraph that the entirely-new (to the reader) assumption—that you can \u0016x your own minor breakdowns—is \u0016rst introduced. Yet its novelty is deliberately concealed; it is presented as though it were simply another rephrasing of the by-now already accepted dependability conclusion. ere is therefore no break in the logical \u0019ow of proof. Acceptance is built into this entirely new statement in these four diﬀerent ways: 1. By paragraph parallelism. By framing the statement as the last of a series of similar paragraphs—all the others of which have already been accepted—instead of physically setting it oﬀ as a new point with its own sub head and a diﬀerent construction, as the reader would ordinarily expect. 2. By the lead word, “And,” a tie-in phrase, which indicates that the sentence accompanying it is the same as those that have gone before. 3. By immediately following “And” by a second tie-in phrase, “most important,” which again implies that the remainder of the statement is part of the series that has gone before. 4. And \u0016nally, by repeating the phrase, “these experts have discovered,” which echoes the identifying subhead at the beginning of the series, and carries on the acceptance-momentum of the series as a whole. All these deliberate constructions combine to give this short, but vital, transitional paragraph the acceptance, and therefore the believability, of all the careful planning that has gone before it. ey allow the reader to make what otherwise might be a jarring transition from already- established proof to an entirely new promise with a minimum of eﬀort. Now the ad builds its \u0016nal step—showing that the only repairs that the average owner will have to make are actually minor external adjustments on his set. Notice how it integrates this new extension of its previous thought into what has gone before by starting with the phrase, once again, “ese experts have discovered…” Here are the next three paragraphs: FIVE MINUTES A WEEK FOR PERFECT RECEPTION. “These TV experts have discovered that your TV set is a great deal like your body in this respect—that it gives you warning signals before it has a major breakdown. For instance, after your set was installed, it probably played perfectly for the ﬁrst week. But then it began to suﬀer from the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to ﬂop over or ﬂicker—lines may appear on your screen. “Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside

set will weaken, you will get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call a repairman.” e second goal-conclusion of the ad has now been reached. At this stage of the copy, the reader now knows: 1. at his set is dependable enough to avoid major breakdowns during by far the greatest majority of the time he will play it; and 2. at if he obtains the proper knowledge, he can correct minor breakdowns himself, and help prevent the gradual formation of major breakdowns, by making a few simple adjustments to the outside controls of his set. erefore, the stage has now been set for the \u0016nal conclusion—the pay-oﬀ conclusion—a conclusion with all the inevitable logical force of a syllogism—that: 3. e owner should obtain this knowledge—make these minor adjustments himself—and therefore save the money he is paying today for service contracts, and save by far the greatest majority of the money he is paying for repair bills. Here is how this \u0016nal conclusion is phrased by the copy: “It’s as simple as that. You pay a repairman—not for his work—but for his knowledge. If you had that knowledge yourself—then you would not have to pay him at all.” A Restatement of Our Basic eory We have taken a great deal of space to analyze, in exact detail, one ad, and the structure of believability that underlies the eﬀectiveness of its claims. We have done this for two reasons: 1. To show how the goal-conclusion—the introduction of the product claim itself—may be made far more eﬀective if it is delayed till the prospect has been prepared to accept it. And 2. To show how this full acceptance—this willingness to believe without question-can gradually be built up, layer by layer agreement by agreement, by use of the proper structure. Let us now state formally some of the rules we have discovered in this analysis, and some of the devices you can use time aer time, to create the maximum structural believability for each of your advertisements. Here are the basic principles: Gradualization is the art of stating a claim in such a way that it will receive the greatest possible acceptance and/or believability from your prospect. Belief ultimately depends upon structure. Just as desire depends upon promise, so belief in that promise depends upon the amount of preparation that promise has been given before your reader is asked to accept it. One fully-believed promise has ten times the sales power oen partially-believed promises. Most copy writers try to strengthen ads by piling promise upon promise. What they usually get for their troubles is greater sales resistance from their prospects and trouble from the ETC. ey could far better invest the same time in strengthening the believability-structure of the original justi\u0016able promise.

Once you get the feel of using them, you’ll probably develop a whole armory of your own. 1. e Inclusion Question Designed to permit immediate identi\u0016cation with your story. To show the prospect that you’re talking about him—not about someone else who would answer No to the question. erefore, once he’s identi\u0016ed with the questions—once he’s made his \u0016rst agreements with you and placed himself in the Yes-answer group—then your recommendations will have special meaning for him. is is perhaps the most direct way of building agreement at the beginning of the ad. It’s used every day. For example, in this advertisement—highly successful—for a book called e Art of Sel\u0016shness: ASK YOURSELF THESE NINE QUESTIONS 1. Do you ﬁnd it increasingly diﬃcult to cope with the world around you… 2. Is your business or career a source of annoyance and frustration… 3. Are you tormented by inadequacies, fear and embarrassments in your sex life… And so on. 2. Detailed Identi\u0016cation Another device used at the beginning of the ad, to establish immediate, and deep, agreement between the reader and the copy. Here, instead of asking questions to set up your Yes-train, you detail symptoms or problems that are your prospect’s reasons for desiring your product. us, again, your reader knows that you are talking about him—that you “have been there yourself”—and therefore that your recommendations will help answer these problems, his problems, that you have catalogued so well. For example, in this ad for a course to improve the prospect’s child’s grades in school: Let me explain. I don’t care whether your child is six years old or twenty—boy or girl—in grade school high school or college. It makes no diﬀerence how badly that child is doing in school today—how diﬃcult it is for him to concentrate … how poor his memory may be … how much a prisoner he is of crippling mental habits … how terriﬁed he may be of mathematics, or grammar, or social studies, or even the hardest science course. Of course, here—as in the Inclusion-Question—your copy must be accurate. You must know enough about the reader’s problems to make every word you write ring true. If you don’t, you’ll shatter your believability-net, and he’ll simply turn the page. So—before you write—research. Learn to know your customer. is is always the essential \u0016rst step, in any kind of copy. 3. Contradiction of Present (False) Beliefs Again, used at the beginning of the ad. And again used to prepare a foundation for strong claim-statements that the reader might never accept raw. Here, you come bluntly out and say, “I know you think this is true; but I’m going to show YOU it’s false.” Best used, of course, in conjunction with strong authority strong enough to contradict present (unpleasant) beliefs, and get away with it.

Forget anything you have ever believed about how “old” you must look at thirty … forty … ﬁfty … or even sixty. Here you are not looking for agreement as much as you are for a loosening of previous beliefs. You are saying that the old limitations are passing, and your next paragraph should be your \u0016rst introduction of your positive claims, in somewhat the same way that this ad goes on: Because—starting with this moment—you are about to enter into a new world of beauty! A world where ordinary fruits are transformed into anti-wrinkle cosmetics. Where a… And so on. 4. e Language of Logic So far, the devices we have discussed have been used to build belief at the beginning of your ad—to serve in the crucial transition from your headline to the stream of intensi\u0016ed promises that you are going to use to close the sale. We have discussed the process of intensifying desire in Chapter 7. We now turn to the simultaneous, and equally important, task of maintaining belief in each new statement as you present it. Here again, your objective is to build belief at the same exact time that you build desire. To do this, you interlace each new promise with language-signals that show that it logically follows from everything that has been proved before. And that it therefore can be believed without hesitation. What are these language-signals? ey are, of course, the vocabulary of logic. ey are the words we use when we reason: when we argue; when we prove our point in any discussion, and force others to agree with us that we are right. ey are among the most powerful words in the English language— for the very simple reason that they give the \u0019avor of conviction to the promises into which we weave them. ese words have been used for centuries in court, in politics, in science—even in that most-loved form of American \u0016ction, detective stories—to show others that proof has been oﬀered, that reason has been used, that one statement logically and inevitably follows from another. erefore, aer centuries of conditioning, the words themselves— regardless of the content of the statements to which they are attached— now carry conviction. erefore, they should be woven throughout your ad, wherever they logically apply. For example, let’s look at some individual lines, in a number of diﬀerent ads. Let’s see how each of these words (which I’ll italicize) gives a tone of reason and logic to those sentences in which they’re incorporated. For example, in the famous Sherwin Cody ad: Why do so many ﬁnd themselves at a loss for words to express their meaning adequately?

There is a basic, underlying reason for this. Mr. Given shows you how to ﬁnd that reason and then explains the means of correcting it. The whole solution can be surprisingly easy once you have realized the underlying causes… Or, for a book on learning how to learn: … but simply by putting your LOCKED-UP LEARNING POWERS to work—today—as easily and logically as this… And so on. ere are dozens of such phrases for you to use. Among them are: “This has been proved by thousands…” “Sound impossible? Not at all. It’s actually as simple…” “Here’s why…” “And, most important of all, is the fact that…” “Therefore …” “This was, without a doubt, the most thorough…” “They discovered—in case after case—that…” is, again, is the language of logic. It is a language equally as \u0016lled with emotion as the language of desire. Interwoven into your promises, so subtly that the reader never even notices that it is there, it gives your claims the invaluable air of conviction. 5. Syllogistic inking Now we go from the language of logic to the mechanisms of logic. is is the role that reason plays in your ad. is is the moment when you prove that your product works, through the mechanism of logical reasoning. For example, in one of the most successful automotive accessory ads of all time, the copywriter wanted to prove that his spark plug was superior to the ordinary plug—even though it costs twice as much. Since the point of diﬀerence was simply that his plug delivered a larger spark, the copywriter built up his case in this way: Your car runs because gasoline is fed into the cylinders where a spark causes it to ﬁre. This action causes the gas to explode … this explosion pushes down the piston. Now here is the important thing to you. The larger the spark is, the more powerful the explosion. The more powerful the explosion, the more power you get from your gasoline. Poor explosion means wasted gas—loss of power, poor getaway, bad starting, a sluggish car. Good explosion means more miles per gallon—more horsepower; a more exciting car to drive! Notice the power of these three simple paragraphs. Power derived as much from their underlying formal structure as from their claims. One statement inevitably leads into another. Every word is logical. ere is a constant process of equation: spark to power, power to performance. Size equals power—and his plug delivers the largest size. Such structure—and the copy based on such a structure—develops the feeling of inevitability. e reader feels that the product must work. He has not only been told it works; he has been shown proof that it works. Such structure—though hidden behind the words it clothes itself in— is actually a physical entity. You can seek it out of hundreds of ads, if you look beneath the words themselves. You can trace it, codify it, and then repeat it.

We will explore these structures in more depth in the next two chapters—on Rede\u0016nition and Mechanization. 6. Other Belief Forms Once you grasp the fundamental idea that form—structure— determines believability, then all sorts of opportunities open up to you. You realize that simply by the arrangement of your claims, you can add to their believability. For example: Contingency Structures—such as “If… then …”, or “Is your… then….” Repetition of Proof: Echoing—such as “ese experts found… ese experts found… ese experts found…” Promise—Belief—Promise Variation. Where every sentence of promise is followed (ideally) with another of proof, or veri\u0016cation, or documentation. So that the reader never has the breathing space to question. Paragraph Parallelism. Where the same word structure used in an accepted statement is then picked up exactly, and used to borrow acceptance for a fresh claim. ere are many more, of course. Some are words, some are chains of reasoning, some are merely the physical arrangement of the copy on the page. All have the same objective. To gain continued acceptance. To prevent rejection. To build conviction. Belief is the goal. Now let us look at some other methods of reinforcing it. 5 - THE FOURTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: REDEFINITION How to Remove Objections to Your Product Time and time again, you are going to have to sell a product that has built-in handicaps. at—along with its promises and its functions—also has certain aspects to it that actually repel the prospect. No product, of course, is perfect. If only for the reason that he must pay money for what you have to sell, your prospect starts with a basic minimum of resistance against buying your product. But this resistance is intensi\u0016ed by certain drawbacks in some products, oen to the point where—unless you take de\u0016nite action in your ad to rede\u0016ne them—these drawbacks will actually kill your sale. Let us now look at the three general categories of drawback, and then at the three types of rede\u0016nition that eliminates them. First, of course, there is the product that is (or that sounds) too complicated—too hard to use. Second, there is the product that is not important enough—whose basic appeal doesn’t have a statistically broad enough market. And third, there is the product that just costs too much. Its price is so much above the price of other products in its class that people simply turn away when it’s mentioned. It’s amazing how many products fall into one or all of these categories. Fortunately, the same mechanism—rede\u0016nition—helps you deal with all three. Rede\u0016nition is the process of giving a new de\u0016nition to your product. It says that the product is this rather than that. Its objective is to remove a roadblock to your sale—if possible, before the prospect even knows it exists. Perhaps the classic case of rede\u0016nition is that of Lifebuoy soap in the irties. Lifebuoy was a good soap that did a good cleaning job.

power, the problem became one of rede\u0016nition. Put simply: how do we change this odor from a liability into an asset? e answer, of course, was the famous B.O. campaign. e prospect’s attention was focused on the odor of his own body—an odor which he was told would drive away people (and which does). He was then told this odor must be eradicated—not with an ordinary soap, which was not powerful enough to do the job but with a soap with the odor-destroying power to make a longshoreman acceptable at a society ball. Lifebuoy was this super-powerful soap. And the overwhelming proof—that you could smell the moment you opened the wrapper—was the strong medicinal odor built into every cake. is is the simplest, and oen the most eﬀective kind of rede\u0016nition. A simple concept-judo. A complete reversal. Turning a liability into an asset, with a single idea. Wherever you can use this \u0019ip-\u0019op method, do so. But most problems of rede\u0016nition are more complicated, and demand more complicated means of dealing with them—using many of the devices we have just examined in the process of Gradualization. Let us now turn to these devices, and see how they can present an entirely diﬀerent image of the product to the prospect than you would have imagined, had you not thought them through beforehand. 1. Simpli\u0016cation Our \u0016rst category is the overcomplicated product—the product that sounds too hard. To see how to replace this image with a more favorable one, let’s look again at the Television Repair Book ad that we discussed in the last chapter. As you remember, the original ad for this product failed because it promised “Do your own TV repairs” in its headline. is was considered too diﬃcult by the average set owner (even though the ad said “It’s easy, it’s simple, it’s quick” in the next paragraph). erefore—since the ad confronted the prospect with the fact that he would have to make repairs before it made those repairs easy and simple and quick—he simply turned the page and tuned the ad out. e second ad did not discuss repairs. It discussed breakdowns and expenses. And, as we have seen, it spent its \u0016rst several paragraphs showing that these breakdowns and expenses did not have to occur at all, if the sets were given the proper care. Up to this point, the ad has talked about the prospect’s world—and compared it with a far more promising world where expert care produces trouble-free TV viewing. Now the two worlds must be joined through the product. is joining is called by the pitchman, “the turn.” It is a transition of great delicacy. It must be accomplished without a jar.

paragraph parallelism tie this statement into the stream of belief that has been built up before it. Now, however, we are going to look at this same paragraph from another point of view—to see how it provides the \u0016rst step in eliminating any fear of making your own repairs. Notice, of course, that the very fear of the average owner, that he is not a repairman, is here brought out in the open—speci\u0016cally stated—but now framed as a promise. Notice too that there is no mention of the word, “repair,” at this point. It is still too early at this point. ough the average owner might be willing to accept the idea that he could “coax” better performance out of his set, it would still be too much to ask him to believe that he could make repairs on that set at this point. is leads to the \u0016nal step. e ad must now rede\u0016ne what the reader thinks of when he hears the word “repairs.” It must now lay a new foundation of feet—showing that almost all the repairs the owner will have to make are actually only minor external adjustments. It now proceeds to do this, in the following three paragraphs which we have already studied in the last chapter, and which we will now look at again to see the second process of persuasion-rede\u0016nition—which is also occurring in them. Here are the paragraphs again: FIVE MINUTES A WEEK FOR PERFECT RECEPTION. These TV experts have discovered that your TV set is a great deal like your body in this respect—that it gives you warning signals before it has a major breakdown. For instance, after your set was installed, it probably played perfectly for the ﬁrst week. But then it began to suﬀer from the vibration, the jarring, the interference of other electrical appliances in your home. The picture might suddenly begin to ﬂop over or ﬂicker—lines may appear on your screen. Now—and this is important—if you had the knowledge to quickly make a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of your set, then you could correct those symptoms, you could keep that set playing perfectly, and you could prevent major breakdowns in exactly the same way they were prevented in these manufacturers’ tests. If you do not have this knowledge … if you do not make these adjustments, then your set will weaken, you will get a consistently bad picture, and you will have to call a repairman. Now, what occurs in these four paragraphs is actually a rede\u0016nition of the term, “repairs” in the reader’s mind. is is done in three separate, but integrated, ways: 1.

cold. Because of this comparison, some of the mystery of the set is explained away; and the owner gains a new feeling of con\u0016dence in dealing with it himself, as something he understands. And, at the same time, this comparison distinguishes between the relatively rare major breakdowns, and the far more frequent minor maladjustments, which he can now treat himself as easily as he’d take a cold tablet to stop his running nose. 2. ‘By continuously describing these minor maladjustments as “warning signals” and “symptoms” rather than “breakdowns” or “repairs.” is makes them sound easily corrected—before real trouble, which might require technical skill and complicated tools, can develop out of them. 3. And \u0016nally, by stating outright that these minor adjustments can be corrected by “making a few minor adjustments, on the outside controls of your set.” erefore, “repairs” are rede\u0016ned as “adjustments.” Troubles on the TV screen are rede\u0016ned as ‘warning signals” or “symptoms.” And “repair calls” or “breakdowns” are carefully segregated into the least-likely-to- occur 5% of all possible TV troubles. erefore, with this rede\u0016nition in mind—with this reorganization of facts accomplished by the copy—there is no longer any reason for the average set owner not to make his own minor adjustments, rather than pay a repairman to make them for him. e objective has been accomplished. e ad can now go on to speci\u0016cally state how much money the owner will save by making these adjustments—and where he can buy the book that tells him how. In exactly the same way, whenever there is a process which is diﬃcult… whenever there is a product which is hard to use, or diﬃcult to apply—the copy writer’s \u0016rst task is to simplify that application in his prospect’s mind. is holds especially true for new inventions which actually simplify processes which formerly were too diﬃcult for the average prospect. A new breakthrough is not merely accepted because its manufacturer says so. Its claims for ease and simplicity must be proved, in the ad, or the reader will simply shrug his shoulders and say “it’s just another copywriter gone wild.” Such a situation is one of the most frustrating experiences you can have. Here is a product which you know is far easier to use than anything ever introduced in this \u0016eld before—because you’ve used it! But no matter how loud you scream EASY in your ads, people just seem to ignore you. What do you do? e answer is twofold: 1. Rede\u0016ne (as this chapter shows you). 2. Mechanize the new simplicity (as you’ll see in the next chapter). Remember, innovation without acceptance is valueless. e more people know that something is diﬃcult, and the more revolutionary (and therefore diﬀerent) your product is—the more resistance you will meet from them in accepting it.

solutions the copy oﬀered that made the product a success. One of the great ads of all times, of course, is the Sherwin Cody ad. ough most advertising men are familiar with the ad, they do not realize that the course itself was a tremendous departure for the times—far easier and simpler than anything else that had gone before. But the prospects for such a course were absolutely convinced that good English was too hard for them. ey had tried to learn it before, and had failed. erefore, any new course that could be successfully sold to them would have to rede\u0016ne English for them … rede\u0016ne mistakes in English for them … and certainly rede\u0016ne the process of turning; bad English into good English for them. e Cody ad is a masterpiece of Gradualization. It should be memorized—not merely studied—by every copywriter. However, within it, in four paragraphs, is contained another masterpiece of breakthrough rede\u0016nition—from hard to easy with a few simple ideas—that goes like this: Only 15 Minutes a Day. Nor is there very much to learn. In Mr. Cody’s years of experimenting, he brought to light some highly astonishing facts about English. For instance, statistics show that a list of sixty-nine words (with their repetitions) make up more than half of all our speech and letter-writing. Obviously, if we could learn to spell, use and pronounce these words correctly, we would go far toward eliminating incorrect spelling and pronunciation. Similarly, Mr. Cody proved that there were no more than one dozen fundamental principles of punctuation. If we mastered these principles, there would be no bugbear of punctuation to hamper us in our writing. Finally he discovered that twenty-ﬁve typical errors in grammar constitute nine-tenths of our everyday mistakes. When one has learned how to avoid these twenty-ﬁve pitfalls, how readily one can obtain the facility of speech which denotes the person of breeding and education! When the study of English is made so simple, it becomes clear that progress can be made in a very short time. No more than ﬁfteen minutes a day is required us the complicated becomes simple—the hard becomes easy. is is the \u0016rst use of Rede\u0016nition. Now let’s look at the second: 2. Escalation Here you are dealing with a product which works, and which is acknowledged to be easy enough to use—but which simply does not have an appeal broad enough to assure it of a mass market. Your job here is to escalate your product. To give it more importance in your prospect’s eyes. You do this again by Rede\u0016nition. You broaden the horizon of bene\u0016ts of the product. You rede\u0016ne the role that the product plays in the prospect’s life.

By now people are not as sensitive to their punctuation or grammar. Now the negative aspect has lost its appeal; people want good English as a persuasion tool to win over other people. So good English must cease to be an end in itself. It must be rede\u0016ned, to become instead a means to a more important end—one which is desired by far more people. And, since the positive aspect must now be dominant, that part of good English which has the greatest value for persuading people—vocabulary—must now be featured. Here is the ad: REVOLUTIONARY NEW WORD POWER MACHINE MAKES YOU A MASTER OF ENGLISH OVERNIGHT. Automatically gives you a power-packed vocabulary— to make your ideas crackle with excitement … to hold others spellbound with the power of your speech and your written word. Automatically spots embarrassing errors in grammar, spelling, pronunciation you didn’t even know you were making. Clears them up at once. Frees your mind from worry … lets you feel at ease in any company … gives you the blazing new self-conﬁdence you need to make anybody like you—to win people over irresistibly to your point of view… . is approach rede\u0016nes the bene\u0016ts of the product, shiing them from a less desirable area to one that will generate more sales appeal. But this use of escalation—to increase bene\u0016t appeal—is only one of the ways it can serve you. Another is to increase the importance of the product—showing that something the prospect wants very much hinges directly upon the performance of your product. For example, in an ad for spark plugs, this fact was pointed out to the reader: Yes. You pay $2,000 … $3,000 … $4,000 for your car. And a single 99c part robs you of the real power and enjoyment that car should give you. Or here, in an advertisement for a speed math course: If you want to get ahead fast… if you want a position of real importance and responsibility—then a knowledge of this kind of super-fast, super-accurate mathematics is AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY for your future! Or escalation can be used to show the prospect that your product is not something to be put to work just once or twice a week—but that it will be needed, and used, by him almost even waking minute. Here’s how this was done, in a single sub headline, in an ad for a course on handling people: Your Entire Life is Spent Trying to Get Others to Do What You Want— Without Friction You must agree with this statement. And therefore you must rede\u0016ne the importance to yourself of a technique which allows you to accomplish the all-pervading task more easily, more eﬀectively and more rapidly is is the second use of Rede\u0016nition—escalation.

product cost too much? Because it’s being compared with other products in the same \u0016eld. And how do you whittle away, psychologically, at this price? By switching the comparison, and relating it to some other, more expensive standard. For example, here is an enormously successful mail order ad for spark plugs, which sold for $1.49 each, or one and a half times the standard for the \u0016eld, and twice as much as the discount price. Did the copywriter therefore say that “ey may cost a little more, but they’re worth every cent of it.” Of course not. He made them cheap, and he did it in these two paragraphs of psychological rede\u0016nition: Up to now these extraordinary SA FIRE INJECTORS were practically made by hand and would have to sell for as high as $5 each. But we knew that 30 or 40 dollars was more than the average driver could aﬀord—so we decided to get the price down so low that these injectors would pay for themselves 12 times in one year of driving. So here is my astonishing proposition. If you will check your cars performance before and after you install your SA Fire Injector System and then tell your friends and neighbors about them, here is what I am prepared to do for you: You can have a set of SA FIRE INJECTORS for the year and model of your ear for only a fraction of their value. If you act now they are only $1.49 each… Do you see how he does it? Do you see how many times he does it in these two short paragraphs? As a last review of rede\u0016nition—because its techniques are so important to you—let’s just list the individual phrases that build up again and again, the feeling of value and bargain. Here they are. Did you catch them all? “practically made by hand …” “would have to sell for as high as $5 each …” “30 or 40 dollars …” (Notice that he repeats the hand-made price twice. First he gives it to you per plug; and then for the entire set. us the new comparative price is reinforced; you practically wince at the $40 \u0016gure since you want the plugs by this time. And you’re going to feel pretty good when he brings in the now-lower \u0016gure in the next paragraph.) “get the price down so low …” (Here is the magic word, “low”; now legitimatized in your eyes by the description of the hand-made set in the phrases that preceded it.) “that these injectors would pay for themselves 12 times in one year of driving…” (Not only value, but reward. Not only low-priced, but gas- saving.

And most of it—perhaps all of it—is never consciously noticed by the prospect. He simply realizes that he feels that a bargain is being oﬀered to him.) “If you will check your car’s performance… and tell your friends and neighbors about them …” (e introduction of a condition—an action you must perform—in order to get the now-low price. Used before in the last chapter in a diﬀerent context: here we see how the same device works again to substantiate with equal power, the feeling of value.) “prepared to do …” (Again the connotation of favor, of allowance, of discount.) “You can have …” (Not, “You can buy.” He is letting you have the plugs at the low price. Again, he is doing you a favor. You are getting a bargain.) “only $1.49 each …” (e classic modi\u0016er. e tenth bargain-phrase in these two paragraphs.) Notice how similar Gradualization and Rede\u0016nition are. Notice how each operates below the surface of the conscious mind. Gradualization by its structure—by its arrangement of facts and phrases. Rede\u0016nition by its rearrangement of perspective. Each is an extremely subtle and powerful way of building belief. Each deserves much more study than we can give it in this book. Let us now turn to some equally powerful but more apparent mechanisms that also build belief. 6 - THE FIFTH TECHNIQUE OF BREAKTHROUGH COPY: MECHANIZATION How to Verbally Prove at Your Product Does What You Claim As we have observed repeatedly, good advertising copy exists simultaneously in two diﬀerent places. Part of that copy is words on a page. Or sounds carried by radio waves. Or pictures and sounds coming out of a television set. But the other part of that copy—the crucial part— takes place in your prospect’s brain. It is the series of reactions—planned reactions and anticipated reactions—that your copy causes in his mind and his emotions. Actually, when your prospect reads your copy, he is engaging in a silent dialogue with you. You are feeding him ideas and images and emotions, in a planned pattern; and he is feeding back to you reactions to these ideas and images and emotions. You hope—you plan—that these reactions will be favorable. at they will be controlled reactions. at he will see the images you are projecting. at he will understand and agree with the ideas that you are advocating. at he will share the emotions you are suggesting he feel, and even embellish and intensify them. But also, at the same moment, you must be aware of the fact that— included among these reactions—are also a number of inevitable anticipations, or demands, or questions on his part. And you must answer these questions or your copy will fail. What are these demands he is going to make from time to time on your copy? Basically they fall into three classes: 1.

He is saying to you: “Tell me more.” 2. Demands for proof. He knows he wants it; now he wants to know that it’s true. He is telling you: “Oh yeah? Who says so?” 3. Demands for a mechanism. He knows he wants the end result; now he wants to know how you’re going to give it to him. He is saying: “How does it work?” To write good copy, you have to play a dual role. At the same time, you have to be copywriter and prospect. You have to develop an almost foolproof sensitivity to these inevitable reactions. You have to know the exact point that they are going to come in. You have to anticipate them. You have to switch copy direction, \u0016ll in the wanted material, at the precise point that your prospect loses interest in one theme and demands the other. is is one of the most diﬃcult parts of writing copy, and the exact spot where many good ads break down and lose their prospect. And—since such anticipation points occur several times in a single ad— you will \u0016nd yourself working over the same paragraph of “unimportant” copy hour aer hour. All you know is that at this point something went wrong—at this point your prospect is dissatis\u0016ed. We will discuss these problems of copy direction … anticipation points … etc. in Chapter 14, on Interweaving. At this point, however, let’s look more closely at the third demand: the demand for Mechanism. Verbal Proof is is the vital question: “How does it work?” Your prospect is asking you here to give him a mechanism. He likes what you promise—he wants what you promise—but he has to be convinced that your product can actually give it to him. You have to demonstrate your product, in words, logically, so that he can understand exactly HOW it gives him the end result you promise. Since the beginning of advertising, of course, the copy that furnishes this information—that provides this mechanism—has been called “Reason Why” copy. Claude Hopkins was its master. But there have been few great selling ads of any period that do not use it to convince their prospect that their product actually works. In fact, the basic question you must ask yourself, about this device, when you sit down to write a piece of copy, is not, “Should I use it?” Or “Should I build a mechanism into this copy?” But simply: “How much?” How much mechanism does this copy need? is, of course, depends —as so many other things in your copy—on the State of Awareness of your prospect. Is he familiar with the mechanism by which this product works? Does he accept it? If so, then this part of your job is done for you.

For instance, in the conventional camera ad, to back the headline claim, all that you’d have to do is name your mechanisms, like this: TAKE FOOLPROOF PHOTOS WITH THE XENOPHON 1750 With Electronic Light Setter… Push-Button Zomar Lens … Magazine Load … Only $135. Here, the three mechanisms which ensure the perfect pictures are simply named, and not described at all. e prospect is already familiar with the way they work from the other ads he has seen, and any further detailing of their nuts and bolts would simply bore him. erefore, you name them in as bold type as possible, and go on to compete with your price. Most catalog copy and retail copy needs to assume only this abbreviated form. It deals with products which are already known, and whose mechanisms are already understood and accepted. erefore, any further wordage on these points would only be wasted. But now we come to that vast array of products whose mechanism cannot simply be named. Why? For two basic reasons: Stage Two: Describe the Mechanism 1. Because the prospect doesn’t understand their mechanism. And: 2. Because everybody else has the same mechanism, and the same promise, and the same price. And the market is getting tired, and you need a new way to compete. Let’s look at the simplest case—case #1—\u0016rst: Here your mechanism is not so well known, or not known at all, and you can’t simply name it. You have to go into more detail; you have to describe it. So you have the classic situation of Promise—Reason Why. You build a strong, quick promise—and then you follow up with the reason why you can deliver that promise. is one-two punch of promise and reason why is as old as advertising itself. Here, for instance, is how Rinso used it in 1926. First they give the promise, like this: Who else wants a whiter wash—with no hard work? How would you like to see your wash come out of a simple soaking—whiter than hours of scrubbing could make it! Millions of women do it every week. They’ve given up washboards for good. They’ve freed themselves forever from the hard work and reddened hands of washday. Now they just soak—rinse—and hang out to dry! In half the time, without a bit of hard rubbing, the wash is on the line—whiter than ever! Notice how the original promise in the headline has been taken and intensi\u0016ed in these \u0016rst three paragraphs of copy. e promise is repeated, in diﬀerent words and from diﬀerent perspectives, over and over again in those \u0016rst three paragraphs. But notice too that—as the copy builds desire—it also builds a growing reaction on the part of the woman reading it. is reaction can be expressed in one word: “How?” is promise sounds better and better … it begins to sound too good to be true … now she needs reassurance fast.

mechanism, like this: Dirt ﬂoats oﬀ—stains go. The secret is simply Rinso—a mild, granulated soap that gives rich, lasting suds even in the hardest water. Just soak the clothes in the creamy Rinso suds—and the dirt and stains ﬂoat oﬀ. Rinse—and the wash is spotless. Even the most soiled parts need only a gentle rub between the ﬁngers to make them snowy. Thus clothes last longer, for there’s no hard rubbing against a board. Notice, \u0016rst of all, that this mechanism—the suds that \u0019oat oﬀ dirt— is sold just as hard as the whiteness story it is brought in to prove. e \u0016rst rule of mechanism copy is that it is not scienti\u0016c discourse. You must never allow it to become dull, or merely factual. You must load it with promise, load it with emotion. Every word in good copy—including mechanism copy—sells. Only in these paragraphs, the copy is selling a secondary claim (dirt \u0019oating oﬀ) that proves the primary claim (a whiter wash). But still—it sells. Secondly, of course, you’ll immediately notice how simple the mechanism is in this 1926 copy, as compared with the same \u0016eld today. In those days it was enough to mention the facts that the suds \u0019oated oﬀ the dirt; the reader accepted, as an evident truth, the fact that they would do so. Today, of course, in our much more sophisticated and exploited market, she would no longer do so. Today you would need far more mechanism. You would have to explain more, promise deeper, perhaps even invent a miracle ingredient to do the work for you. Stage ree: Feature the Mechanism Which brings us to case #2 and the diﬃcult problem of what to do when your market is highly sophisticated … when promises sound alike … when price competition becomes suicidal? is takes us back to Chapter 3, where we discussed market- sophistication from another perspective. Here we discovered that mechanism—strong mechanism—saleable mechanism—is not only a way to build belief, but may actually become so important to the success of your product that you must put it into the headline. ese headlines are all mechanism headlines: “FLOATS FAT RIGHT OUT OF YOUR BODY.” “FIRST WONDER DRUG FOR REDUCING.” “RUN YOUR CAR WITHOUT SPARK PLUGS.” “SHRINKS HEMORRHOIDS WITHOUT SURGERY.” “TOMMY ARMOUR SAYS SMACK HELL OUT OF THE BALL WITH YOUR RIGHT HAND.” And hundreds more. Every one of them oﬀers you a new way to get what you’ve been wanting. A NEW WAY; a new mechanism; a new chance to satisfy your desire—even if everything else you’ve tried has failed you. Mechanism, therefore, can be inside your ad, to prove your main claim, or on top of the ad, elevated by the state of your market to becoming the main claim.
